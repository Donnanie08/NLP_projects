<start> homarus gammarus known as the european lobster or common lobster is a species of <unk> lobster from the eastern atlantic ocean mediterranean sea and parts of the black sea it is closely related to the american lobster h. americanus it may grow to a length of <num> cm <num> in and a mass of <num> kilograms <num> lb and bears a conspicuous pair of claws in life the lobsters are blue only becoming lobster red on cooking mating occurs in the summer producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into <unk> larvae homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food and is widely caught using lobster pots mostly around the british isles <stop>
<start> homarus gammarus is a large <unk> with a body length up to <num> centimetres <num> in and weighing up to <num> – <num> kilograms <num> – <num> lb although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually <num> – <num> cm <num> – <num> in long and weigh <num> @.@ <num> – <num> @.@ <num> kg <num> @.@ <num> – <num> @.@ <num> lb like other crustaceans lobsters have a hard <unk> which they must shed in order to grow in a process called <unk> <unk> this may occur several times a year for young lobsters but decreases to once every <num> – <num> years for larger animals <stop>
<start> the first pair of <unk> is armed with a large asymmetrical pair of claws the larger one is the <unk> and has rounded <unk> used for crushing prey the other is the cutter which has sharp inner edges and is used for holding or tearing the prey usually the left claw is the <unk> and the right is the cutter <stop>
<start> the <unk> is generally blue above with spots that <unk> and yellow below the red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking this occurs because in life the red pigment <unk> is bound to a protein complex but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking releasing the red pigment <stop>
<start> the closest relative of h. gammarus is the american lobster homarus americanus the two species are very similar and can be crossed artificially although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap the two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics <stop>
<start> the <unk> of h. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside which are lacking in h. gammarus <stop>
<start> the spines on the claws of h. americanus are red or red @-@ tipped while those of h. gammarus are white or white @-@ tipped <stop>
<start> the underside of the claw of h. americanus is orange or red while that of h. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red <stop>
<start> female h. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of <num> – <num> millimetres <num> @.@ <num> – <num> @.@ <num> in whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size mating typically occurs in summer between a recently <unk> female whose shell is therefore soft and a hard @-@ shelled male the female carries the eggs for up to <num> months depending on the temperature attached to her <unk> females carrying eggs are said to be <unk> and can be found throughout the year <stop>
<start> the eggs hatch at night and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents preying on <unk> this stage involves three <unk> and lasts for <num> – <num> days after the third moult the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult and adopts a <unk> lifestyle the juveniles are rarely seen in the wild and are poorly known although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows it is estimated that only <num> larva in every <num> @,@ <num> survives to the <unk> phase when they reach a carapace length of <num> mm <num> @.@ <num> in the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives <stop>
<start> homarus gammarus is found across the north @-@ eastern atlantic ocean from northern norway to the azores and morocco not including the baltic sea it is also present in most of the mediterranean sea only missing from the section east of crete and along only the north @-@ west coast of the black sea the <unk> populations are found in the norwegian <unk> <unk> and <unk> inside the arctic circle <stop>
<start> the species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations one widespread population and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes possibly due to adaptation to the local environment the first of these is the population of lobsters from northern norway which have been referred to as the midnight @-@ sun lobster the populations in the mediterranean sea are distinct from those in the atlantic ocean the last distinct population is found in the netherlands samples from the <unk> were distinct from those collected in the north sea or english channel <stop>
<start> attempts have been made to introduce h. gammarus to new zealand alongside other european species such as the edible crab cancer <unk> between <num> and <num> one million lobster larvae were released from <unk> in <unk> but the species did not become established there <stop>
<start> adult h. gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of <num> – <num> metres <num> – <unk> ft although not normally deeper than <num> m <num> ft they prefer hard substrates such as rocks or hard mud and live in holes or crevices emerging at night to feed <stop>
<start> the diet of h. gammarus mostly consists of other <unk> invertebrates these include crabs molluscs sea <unk> <unk> and polychaete worms <stop>
<start> the three <unk> lobster species homarus gammarus h. americanus and <unk> <unk> are hosts to the three known species of the animal <unk> <unk> the species on h. gammarus has not been described <stop>
<start> homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease <unk> caused by the <unk> <unk> <unk> although it is frequently found in american lobsters the disease has only been seen in captive h. gammarus where prior occupation of the tanks by h. americanus could not be ruled out <stop>
<start> homarus gammarus is traditionally highly esteemed as a <unk> and was mentioned in the <unk> a seventeenth century english folk song it may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh frozen canned or powdered both the claws and the abdomen of h. gammarus contain excellent white meat and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible the exceptions are the <unk> mill and the sand vein gut the price of h. gammarus is up to three times higher than that of h. americanus and the european species is considered to have a better flavour <stop>
<start> <unk> are mostly fished using lobster pots although lines <unk> with <unk> or <unk> sometimes succeed in tempting them out to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand in <num> <num> @,@ <num> t of h. gammarus were caught across europe and north africa of which <num> @,@ <num> t <num> was caught in the british isles including the channel islands the minimum landing size for h. gammarus is a carapace length of <num> mm <num> @.@ <num> in <stop>
<start> <unk> systems for h. gammarus are under development and production rates are still very low <stop>
<start> homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by carl linnaeus in the tenth edition of his systema <unk> published in <num> that name was cancer gammarus since linnaeus concept of the genus cancer at that time included all large crustaceans <stop>
<start> h. gammarus is the type species of the genus homarus weber <num> as determined by direction <num> of the international commission on zoological nomenclature prior to that direction confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names including <unk> <unk> <unk> <num> and homarus vulgaris h. milne @-@ edwards <num> and also because friedrich weber 's description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by mary <unk> rendering any prior assignments of type species for homarus h. milne @-@ edwards <num> invalid for homarus weber <num> <stop>

<start> slayer guitarist jeff hanneman wrote angel of death after reading books about nazi physician <unk> <unk> while on tour with the band i remember stopping <unk> where i bought two books on <unk> i thought this has gotta be some sick shit so when it came time to do the record that stuff was still in my head — that 's where the lyrics to angel of death came from <stop>
<start> the lyrics detail <unk> 's surgical experiments on patients at the auschwitz concentration camp during world war ii <unk> 's <unk> were conducted on such groups as dwarfs and twins and included both physical and psychological examinations among the tests he performed that are mentioned in angel of death are experimental <unk> performed without anesthesia transfusion of blood between twins isolation endurance <unk> <unk> with lethal <unk> sex change operations the removal of organs and limbs and <unk> <stop>
<start> <unk> together joining heads just a matter of time <unk> you rip <unk> apart a line from the penultimate verse is a reference to the allegation <unk> <unk> together twins one of them deformed the <unk> was <unk> to the other child back to back their wrists back to back too this claim was first made by auschwitz survivor <unk> alexander at the <num> trial of ss @-@ <unk> adolf <unk> the architect of the holocaust where it was asserted that <unk> <unk> the veins together and turned them into <unk> twins this allegation became more widely known when <unk> alexander was featured in the <num> documentary the search for <unk> which has been cited by several authors including gerald <unk> an expert on <unk> <stop>

<start> the <unk> blues is regarded as one of lead <unk> 's best original works but it also drew controversy there is doubt over the song 's authorship with some scholars <unk> that lead <unk> was unlikely to have written a work in a genre new to him without a collaborator <unk> have been raised over his role in the american communist party and whether he and the song were used to further the party 's political goals <stop>
<start> most music historians date the writing of the <unk> blues to lead <unk> 's june <num> trip to washington dc when he was invited by the <unk> alan <unk> to record for the library of congress 's folk music collection on the first night lead <unk> and his wife martha spent in the city they encountered racially <unk> jim crow laws similar to those found in their native louisiana most hotels refused to rent rooms to african americans and the few that would were either full or refused to serve him because he was with a white man <unk> <unk> in some versions of the story described as an unnamed white friend offered to let the couple stay for the night in his apartment near the supreme court building the next morning lead <unk> <unk> to <unk> arguing with his <unk> about the presence of a black man with the <unk> threatening to call the police <stop>
<start> while in washington lead <unk> encountered several other incidents of segregation that are believed to have contributed to the <unk> of the song for instance when lead <unk> <unk> and their wives wanted to go out to dinner together they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them lead <unk> was told that if he returned later without <unk> he would be served <stop>
<start> in response to one of these incidents a friend of lead <unk> 's variously identified as either <unk> or mary elizabeth <unk> joked that washington was a <unk> town though lead <unk> did not know what the word <unk> meant he was fascinated by the sound of it and after its meaning was explained to him he decided to incorporate it into a song about the trip the song came together quickly one account claims that it only took a few hours for lead <unk> to write it <unk> liked it because it was partly based on what happened in his apartment <stop>
<start> the <unk> blues is a blues @-@ style protest song that criticizes the culture of washington dc it protests against both the city 's jim crow laws and the racism of its white population its structure includes several verses and a refrain that declares that the speaker is going to spread the news all around about the racial issues <unk> the city the song particularly in the refrain <unk> race and economics by referring to <unk> as <unk> <stop>
<start> the first two verses speak of the segregation that lead <unk> encountered in washington dc the first recounts the fact that during the trip lead <unk> was turned down wherever he tried to get served due to his race while the second recounts the argument between <unk> and his <unk> over lead <unk> staying in his apartment the third verse <unk> cites the home of the brave the land of the free juxtaposed with the mistreatment he received at the hands of white people in washington dc the fourth verse speaks of the racism of the white population of the city leading to the song 's end which suggests that african americans boycott buying homes in the district <stop>
<start> the song 's tone implies that the speaker feels powerless against the discrimination and racism that he encounters despite this by spreading the news of his poor treatment in a song the speaker uses what power he has to tell both southern african americans and northern whites that the status <unk> is deeply flawed and that something needs to change <stop>
<start> the <unk> blues follows a traditional twelve @-@ bar blues format it is written in <num> time but <unk> to note that the song <unk> should swing at medium <unk> the song was written in b ♭ it uses twelve measures with verses one to four repeating followed by the final two verses and a <unk> <stop>
<start> lead <unk> first recorded the <unk> blues in december <num> in new york city for donation to the library of congress he re @-@ recorded the song in april <num> for <unk> records for release the same year as a <num> rpm record the version that was commercially released features lead <unk> singing and playing the twelve @-@ string guitar without any other accompaniment <stop>
<start> the song has been covered and <unk> by a variety of artists including pete seeger and hans <unk> seeger recorded and released both live and studio versions of the song on several of his albums in australia the song was reworked as canberra blues by the <unk> <unk> an r b band the lyrics speak of the problems faced by young australians in the australian capital territory in the 1960s <unk> adapted the song to his style of european blues for the album journey on in <num> <stop>
<start> in <num> billy bragg reworked the song as bush war blues bragg 's cover is a topical protest song about the iraq war in one verse bragg claims that the iraq war was not for democracy but instead was to make the world safe for <unk> in another he takes on the christian right asking where the <unk> are finally bragg <unk> the united states government for not dealing with poverty at home before going to war <stop>
<start> the <unk> blues is one of lead <unk> 's most famous songs and is remembered as his most heartfelt protest song there is disagreement among music scholars as to its importance robert <unk> claims that the song is peripheral to the wider study of the blues while lawson points to it as a watershed in the way african americans see themselves in the fabric of the united states there is debate over the relationship between the song and radical politics after its release it became popular with left @-@ wing political groups lead <unk> was invited to perform at camp unity the communist party usa 's summer retreat and the fbi subsequently opened a file on him in the 1940s this led to the accusations that the communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform the party claims to the contrary that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform <stop>
<start> jeff todd <unk> and several other writers have suggested that lead <unk> had significant help with its authorship and claim it is not a genuine protest song this theory stems from the idea that lead <unk> did not have a history of protest music before he was discovered by <unk> since the music that <unk> recorded was sold to <unk> sympathetic to civil rights it has been suggested that <unk> helped him write a song attractive to a white audience lead <unk> admitted that the term <unk> was unfamiliar to him and it seems out of place compared to the vocabulary of his past work <stop>

<start> <unk> was one of the first tracks developed for confessions on a dance <unk> along with <unk> up and future lovers it was also the one which took the most time to finish because madonna thought it was too melodramatic and could never decide when it was right the songs were developed with a remixed perspective in mind madonna commented that whenever i make records i often like the remixes better than the original ones ... so i thought screw that i 'm going to start from that perspective she promoted the album at the dance party <unk> held at luke <unk> 's nightclub in greenwich village invited by junior <unk> to take over the dj booth where she mixed <unk> up with <unk> musically <unk> is an uptempo dance song containing layers of beats and strong vocal on the chorus it is set in common time with a moderately fast dance groove tempo of <num> beats per minute <unk> in the key of c minor madonna 's vocal range spans from <unk> to <unk> it follows the chord progression of e ♭ – <unk> – a ♭ – b ♭ during the spoken introduction it then changes to <unk> – <unk> @-@ <unk> in the chorus while continuing in a ♭ – <unk> – a ♭ – <unk> in the intermediate verses ultimately ending in repeated lines of i 've heard it all before <stop>

<start> <unk> to the celebratory gesture the high five name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left @-@ turn movements that tower over the landscape the interchange is as high as a <num> @-@ story building and includes <num> bridges spread across five levels the high five <num> support tiers and <num> miles of additional highway the highest ramps are <num> feet <num> m above ground the lanes of us <num> which are on the bottom level are <num> feet <num> m below ground level giving the structure a total height of <num> feet from bottom to top as part of the project i @-@ <num> was widened to include four dedicated high @-@ occupancy vehicle lanes <unk> lanes that are barrier @-@ separated and <unk> <stop>

<start> reasons for upgrading the interchange in addition to the need to increase traffic flow and reduce congestion were to improve air quality safety and local access <stop>
<start> <unk> construction corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the <num> million contract by <unk> the largest ever by that agency the construction contract for the high five interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts for example it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete 's strength the first time <unk> had ever done so and contained an early completion bonus a <unk> scale of up to <num> million if the company completed the contract within four years also built into the construction contract was a provision that <unk> was charged for lane rentals by <unk> for time they closed down traffic lanes — fees based on <unk> assessments and the time of day the lane was closed the fees ranged from <num> to a high of <num> @,@ <num> for rush hours in order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and <unk> so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished <stop>
<start> to save time and money innovative construction methods were employed the original plans called for the segments of the long ramps and spans used to direct @-@ connect roads to be made of steel but because building with steel would interfere with heavy traffic flow during construction cast @-@ in @-@ place segmental concrete was substituted in the plans however <unk> decided to use <unk> concrete segmental bridges rather than casting the bridge elements in place and used a unique machine designed and constructed by deal <unk> of italy and costing about <num> million to move the pieces into place <stop>

<start> in the 13th century the pagan empire along with the khmer empire was one of the two main empires in mainland southeast asia for much of its history pagan 's neighbor to the northeast was not china but the independent <unk> kingdom and its predecessor <unk> both with <unk> as their capital city <unk> @-@ based kingdoms were a power in their own right at times <unk> themselves with the <unk> empire to their west and at other times with china 's tang and song dynasties indeed <unk> 's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of pagan and the pagan dynasty itself <stop>
<start> between the newly conquered <unk> territory and pagan were a wide <unk> of <unk> stretching from present @-@ day <unk> <unk> and <unk> prefectures in <unk> as well as the <unk> and <unk> regions presumably in present @-@ day northern shan state which pagan and <unk> had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence then as now the <unk> mostly consist of <unk> <unk> of high mountain ranges <stop>
<start> the <unk> empire first arrived at the <unk> of the pagan empire in <unk> by invading the <unk> kingdom in its attempt to outflank song china the <unk> armies captured the capital <unk> on <num> january <unk> and went on to <unk> much of the kingdom by <unk> <stop>
<start> the arrival of the mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the <unk> as the mongols were intent on finishing off the song for the next dozen years they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from china to burma and india the mongols set up military garrisons manned mostly by <unk> @-@ speaking muslims from central asia in <num> circuits of the former <unk> kingdom <stop>
<start> by then the pagan empire despite outward appearances of calm had been in long and slow decline since the early 13th century the continuous growth of tax @-@ free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom the crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in <unk> – <num> in south <unk> and <unk> <unk> the decline continued on the eve of the <unk> invasions between one and two @-@ thirds of upper burma 's <unk> land had been donated to religion the crown 's ability to <unk> defenses was in serious jeopardy <stop>
<start> the period of calm for pagan ended in the early <unk> by then the song were on the ropes and emperor <unk> khan who officially founded the yuan dynasty on <num> december <num> sought to cut off the retreat of song refugees in all directions in pagan 's case he had ordered the <unk> governor of <unk> to <unk> control of the <unk> and in january <num> to send a mission to pagan to demand tribute the tribute he demanded was nominal given his higher priority <unk> elsewhere the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at pagan at the border the ruler of the <unk> and <unk> regions submitted to the mongols <stop>
<start> when the <unk> envoys led by <unk> <unk> showed up the pagan court led by chief minister <unk> <unk> was well aware of the military power of the mongols and advised king <unk> to use diplomacy the king was furious at the demand and kept the <unk> envoys waiting for weeks the court finally devised a compromise the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king <unk> them was a <unk> envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the <unk> king 's wish to one day worship a buddha tooth at beijing the king then promptly ordered an expedition which retook the rebellious <unk> regions in april <unk> the rebel leader a @-@ <unk> <unk> was brought back to pagan <unk> relayed the news to beijing but did not carry out any military action <stop>
<start> at beijing <unk> khan who was preparing an invasion of japan decided against a war with pagan — for the time being on <num> march <unk> he sent a <num> @-@ member delegation led by an imperial ambassador the first secretary to the board <unk> to pagan the delegation carried a letter from the emperor the letter says <stop>
<start> if you have finally decided to fulfill your duties towards the all @-@ highest send one of your brothers or senior ministers to show men that all the world is linked with us and enter into a perpetual alliance this will add to your reputation and be in your own interests for if it comes to war who will be the victor <unk> well o king our words <stop>
<start> this time the <unk> king received the imperial envoys but still refused to submit the <unk> chronicles say that the king was so insulted that he had the envoys executed but both <unk> <unk> evidence and yuan records indicate that the envoys were not executed at any rate the imperial envoys did not get back to <unk> in due time the newly formed <unk> government sent another delegation to investigate the whereabouts of the delegation but the delegation could not reach pagan because of an ongoing rebellion en route <stop>
<start> meanwhile in <unk> the former <unk> kingdom was officially reorganized as the province of <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> al @-@ din omar as governor in may <num> the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned that the <unk> evidently had no intention of submitting and that war was the only way forward <stop>
<start> but the emperor rejected an outright invasion just coming off a disastrous japanese campaign the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair he was now focused on delivering the final blow against the song the emperor ordered the <unk> provincial army to secure the <unk> in order to block the escape path of the song refugees he also sanctioned a limited border war if pagan contested the takeover as planned the <unk> army proceeded to consolidate the <unk> in <num> – <num> elsewhere the main <unk> armies had captured most of the song territory by <unk> <stop>
<start> by <unk> at least one <unk> vassal state named gold <unk> modern <unk> had submitted to the mongols like in <unk> the <unk> government responded by sending an army to reclaim the rebellious state but unlike in <unk> the mongols had posted a sizable garrison there though it was ultimately under <unk> command many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were <unk> @-@ speaking peoples or people from the further west turks from <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but also captive soldiers from the persian <unk> empire the <unk> and even <unk> from the lower <unk> <stop>

<start> according to marco polo 's account in the early stages of the battle the turkish and <unk> horsemen took such <unk> at the sight of the <unk> that they would not be got to face the <unk> but always <unk> and turned back while the <unk> forces pressed on but the <unk> commander <unk> did not panic he ordered his troops to <unk> and from the cover of the nearby <unk> aim their bows directly at the advancing <unk> the <unk> <unk> arrows threw the animals into such pain that they fled <stop>

<start> the country fell into chaos in lower burma the king found himself isolated let alone plan a counterattack although his sons ruled the key lower burma ports <unk> <unk> and <unk> the king did not trust any of them and he and his court settled at <unk> west of <unk> without the full support of his sons the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one the governor of <unk> <unk> that same year the king managed to send two small expeditions to <unk> but they both failed now the entire eastern half of lower burma <unk> and <unk> was in open revolt <stop>
<start> given his precarious position <unk> decided to buy time and sue for peace with the mongols in november december <unk> the king ordered his generals <unk> <unk> and <unk> bo to enter into ceasefire negotiations the <unk> commanders at <unk> who had organized northern burma as a protectorate named <unk> chinese <unk> wade – giles <unk> @-@ <unk> agreed to a ceasefire but insisted on a full submission they repeated their <num> demand that the <unk> king send a formal delegation to the emperor the two sides had reached a tentative agreement by <num> march <unk> which calls for a full submission of the pagan empire and central burma to be organized as the province of <unk> chinese <unk> wade – giles <unk> @-@ chung after a long <unk> the king agreed to submit but wanted the <unk> troops to withdraw in june <unk> he sent an embassy led by shin <unk> <unk> a learned monk to the emperor 's court <stop>
<start> in january <unk> the embassy arrived at beijing and was received by the yuan emperor the <unk> delegation formally acknowledged <unk> <unk> of their kingdom and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country indeed the tribute was no longer nominal in exchange the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops for the emperor the burma campaign was the only bright spot his other southeast asian expeditions had gone badly he did not want to invest more troops <unk> the rest of the kingdom he preferred a vassal ruler the <unk> embassy arrived back at <unk> in may <unk> and reported the terms to the king <stop>

<start> recent research shows that the <unk> forces most probably never reached pagan they were held at bay by the <unk> defenses led by commanders <unk> <unk> and <unk> and probably never got closer than <num> km north of pagan an inscription dated <num> february <unk> by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the <unk> army even if the mongols did reach pagan the damage they inflicted was probably minimal at any rate the <unk> army suffered heavy casualties and retreated north to <unk> they remained there as the treaty was now void <stop>
<start> the disintegration of the pagan empire was now complete but the mongols refused to fill in the power vacuum they had created they would send no more expeditions to restore order the emperor apparently had no interest in committing troops that would be required to <unk> the fragmented country indeed his real aim all along may have been to keep the entire region of southeast asia broken and fragmented it would be another two years until one of <unk> 's sons <unk> emerged as king of pagan in may <unk> but the new king controlled just a small area around the capital and had no real army the real power in central burma now rested with the three commander brothers <stop>

<start> the war was one of several near simultaneous wars <unk> by the <unk> empire and the yuan dynasty in the late 13th century though it was never more than a minor frontier war to the mongols the war set off a series of enduring developments in burma the invasions <unk> in a period of political fragmentation and the rise of tai @-@ shan states throughout mainland southeast asia <stop>
<start> the immediate result of the war was the collapse of the pagan empire however the war merely accelerated the collapse but did not cause it pagan 's disintegration was in fact more prolonged and <unk> the kingdom had been in long gradual decline since the early 13th century had pagan possessed a stronger central government the collapse could have been temporary and the country “ could have risen again ” but the dynasty could not recover and because the mongols refused to fill the power vacuum no viable center emerged in the immediate aftermath as a result several minor states fought it out for supremacy for the better part of the 14th century it was only in the late 14th century that two relatively strong powers emerged in the <unk> basin restoring some semblance of normalcy the vast region surrounding the <unk> valley would continue to be made up of several small tai @-@ shan states well into the 16th century <stop>
<start> perhaps the most enduring legacy of the <unk> invasions was the emergence of tai @-@ shan states in mainland southeast asia the tai @-@ shan people who came down with the <unk> invasions stayed by the early 14th century several tai @-@ shan states had come to dominate a vast region from present @-@ day <unk> to northern and eastern <unk> to northern and central thailand and laos their rise was encouraged by the mongols who viewed the states as a useful <unk> between <unk> and the rest of southeast asia the mongols who were still trying to incorporate <unk> into the central administration were unwilling or unable to make necessary sustained investments to bring the vast regions south of <unk> into the fold the integration of <unk> itself into “ china <unk> ” was to take several more centuries and continues to today as such from the newly formed tai @-@ shan states in western and central southeast asia to dai viet and <unk> in eastern southeast asia the mongols elected to receive nominal tribute though the rulers of these states were technically governors of the yuan government they were the native chieftains “ who would have ruled there in any case and they did as they pleased ” <stop>
<start> the war also marked the arrival of china at the <unk> of burma the old <unk> kingdom known to the <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> after <unk> raj was now a <unk> chinese province the <unk> now called the new powers at <unk> <unk> after the <unk> @-@ speaking soldiers of <unk> over the years the term <unk> came to be used to refer to the han chinese today king <unk> is remembered as <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> the king who fled from the <unk> chinese from a <unk> standpoint the <unk> – chinese presence in <unk> pushed the shan migrations in the direction of burma and parts of the khmer empire the raids by various shan states into upper burma would continue until the mid @-@ 16th century <stop>

<start> in the 1st century ad rich burials first appeared and <unk> underwent a political and cultural <unk> as its giant northern neighbors declined at the end of the late <unk> the <unk> style art and architecture from the pacific coast began to influence <unk> as demonstrated by a broken sculpture from the <unk> and early murals at the city <stop>
<start> <unk> rulership among the lowland maya is most deeply rooted at <unk> according to later hieroglyphic records the dynasty was founded by <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> perhaps in the 3rd century ad at the beginning of the early classic power in the maya region was concentrated at <unk> and <unk> in the core of the maya <unk> <stop>
<start> <unk> may have benefited from the collapse of the large <unk> states such as el <unk> in the early classic <unk> rapidly developed into the most dynamic city in the maya region <unk> the development of other nearby maya cities <stop>
<start> the site however was often at war and inscriptions tell of <unk> and conflict with other maya states including <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the site was defeated at the end of the early classic by <unk> which rose to take <unk> 's place as the paramount center in the southern maya lowlands the earlier part of the early classic saw hostilities between <unk> and its neighbor <unk> with <unk> recording the capture of prisoners from <unk> <stop>

<start> <unk> <unk> a small site <num> kilometres <num> mi northeast of <unk> was conquered by the latter during the reign of <unk> <unk> <unk> i. the site became an outpost of <unk> shielding it from hostile cities further north and also became a trade link to the caribbean <stop>
<start> although the new rulers of <unk> were foreign their descendants were rapidly <unk> <unk> became the key ally and trading partner of <unk> in the maya lowlands after being conquered by <unk> <unk> rapidly dominated the northern and eastern <unk> <unk> together with smaller towns in the region were absorbed into <unk> 's kingdom other sites such as <unk> and <unk> de san josé near lake <unk> <unk> became vassals of their more powerful neighbor to the north by the middle of the 5th century <unk> had a core territory of at least <num> kilometres <num> mi in every direction <stop>
<start> around the 5th century an impressive system of fortifications consisting of ditches and earthworks was built along the northern periphery of <unk> 's hinterland joining up with the natural defenses provided by large areas of <unk> lying to the east and west of the city additional fortifications were probably also built to the south these defenses protected <unk> 's core population and agricultural resources <unk> an area of approximately <num> square kilometres <num> sq mi recent research suggests that the earthworks served as a water collection system rather than a defensive purpose <stop>
<start> in the 5th century the power of the city reached as far south as <unk> whose founder k 'inich <unk> k <unk> mo was clearly connected with <unk> <unk> itself was not in an ethnically maya region and the founding of the <unk> dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of <unk> k 'inich <unk> k <unk> mo arrived in <unk> in december <num> and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at <unk> an individual known as <unk> k <unk> mo lord k <unk> mo is referred to in an early text at <unk> and may well be the same person his tomb had <unk> characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior <unk> of <unk> <unk> texts refer to him as lord of the west much like <unk> k ’ <unk> ’ at the same time in late <num> <unk> founded the nearby site of <unk> possibly sponsored by <unk> itself the founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose <unk> 's authority upon the southeastern portion of the maya region the interaction between these sites and <unk> was intense over the next three centuries <stop>
<start> a long @-@ running rivalry between <unk> and <unk> began in the 6th century with each of the two cities forming its own network of mutually hostile <unk> <unk> against each other in what has been likened to a long @-@ running war between two maya <unk> the kings of these two capitals adopted the title <unk> a term that has not been precisely translated but that implies something akin to high king <stop>
<start> the early 6th century saw another queen ruling the city known only as the lady of <unk> who was very likely a daughter of <unk> <unk> ich 'aak ii she seems never to have ruled in her own right rather being partnered with male co @-@ rulers the first of these was <unk> b <unk> who seems to have had a long career as a general at <unk> before becoming co @-@ ruler and 19th in the dynastic sequence the lady of <unk> herself seems not have been counted in the dynastic numbering it appears she was later paired with lord bird claw who is presumed to be the otherwise unknown 20th ruler <stop>
<start> in the mid 6th century <unk> seems to have allied with <unk> and defeated <unk> closing the early classic the <unk> hiatus refers to a period between the late 6th to late 7th century where there was a lapse in the writing of inscriptions and large @-@ scale construction at <unk> in the latter half of the 6th century ad a serious crisis <unk> the city with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation of public sculpture this hiatus in activity at <unk> was long unexplained until later <unk> <unk> identified that the period was prompted by <unk> 's comprehensive defeat at the hands of <unk> and the <unk> polity in ad <num> a defeat that seems to have resulted in the capture and sacrifice of the king of <unk> the badly eroded altar <num> at <unk> described how <unk> suffered this disastrous defeat in a major war in april <num> it seems that <unk> was an ally of <unk> in the wider conflict between that city and <unk> with the defeat of <unk> having a lasting impact upon the city <unk> was not sacked but its power and influence were broken after its great victory <unk> grew rapidly and some of <unk> 's population may have been forcibly relocated there during the hiatus period at least one ruler of <unk> took refuge with <unk> <unk> of palenque another of <unk> 's victims <unk> itself <unk> during <unk> 's long hiatus period <stop>
<start> the beginning of the <unk> hiatus has served as a marker by which archaeologists commonly <unk> the classic period of <unk> chronology into the early and late classic <stop>
<start> in <unk> <unk> founded <unk> <unk> some <num> kilometres <num> mi to the southwest as a military outpost in order to control trade along the course of the <unk> river b <unk> chan k 'awiil was installed on the throne of the new outpost at the age of four in <num> and for many years served as a loyal vassal fighting for his brother the king of <unk> roughly twenty years later <unk> <unk> was attacked by <unk> and was soundly defeated b <unk> chan k 'awiil was captured by the king of <unk> but instead of being sacrificed he was re @-@ instated on his throne as a vassal of his former enemy and attacked <unk> in <unk> forcing <unk> <unk> chaak the then king of <unk> to temporarily abandon the city the first two rulers of <unk> <unk> continued to use the <unk> emblem glyph of <unk> and they probably felt that they had a legitimate claim to the throne of <unk> itself for some reason b <unk> chan k 'awiil was not installed as the new ruler of <unk> instead he stayed at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> against <unk> <unk> in <unk> driving b <unk> chan k 'awiil into an exile that lasted five years <unk> tried to encircle <unk> within an area dominated by its allies such as el peru <unk> <unk> and <unk> <stop>
<start> in <num> <unk> chan k 'awiil i erected the first dated monument at <unk> in <num> years and claimed the title of <unk> so ending the hiatus he initiated a programme of new construction and turned the tables on <unk> when in <unk> he captured the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered after this <unk> never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory <stop>
<start> by the 7th century there was no active <unk> presence at any maya site and the center of <unk> had been razed by <num> even after this formal war attire illustrated on monuments was <unk> style <unk> chan k 'awiil i and his heir <unk> 'in chan k 'awiil continued hostilities against <unk> and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around <unk> extending as far as the territory around lake <unk> <unk> these two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today <stop>
<start> in <num> <unk> a vassal of <unk> <unk> 's key ally in the south switched allegiance to <unk> defeated <unk> and gained its own independence it appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of <unk> to bring about the collapse of <unk> 's southern allies this upset the balance of power in the southern maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of <unk> <stop>
<start> in the 8th century the rulers of <unk> collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the north acropolis by the late 8th century and early 9th century activity at <unk> slowed <unk> architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers <stop>
<start> by the 9th century the crisis of the classic maya collapse was sweeping across the region with populations <unk> and city after city falling into silence increasingly endemic warfare in the maya region caused <unk> 's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and corresponding environmental decline construction continued at the beginning of the century with the erection of temple <num> the last of the city 's major pyramids and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th k <unk> in <unk> the beginning of the 10th <unk> <unk> in <num> passed <unk> and marks the beginning of a <num> @-@ year hiatus probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city during this hiatus satellite sites traditionally under <unk> 's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the <unk> emblem glyph with <unk> apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence in <unk> <unk> k 'awiil is mentioned on a stela at <unk> as visiting that city as the divine lord of <unk> but he is not recorded elsewhere and <unk> 's once great power was little more than a memory the sites of <unk> and <unk> had by now inherited the once exclusive <unk> emblem glyph <stop>
<start> as <unk> and its hinterland reached peak population the area suffered <unk> erosion and nutrient loss followed by a rapid decline in population levels <unk> and its immediate surroundings seem to have lost the majority of its population during the period from <num> to <num> and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly there is not much evidence from <unk> that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the maya region during the terminal classic although an influx of refugees from the <unk> region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources <stop>
<start> in the latter half of the 9th century there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much diminished city of <unk> as evidenced by a stela erected in the great plaza by <unk> chan k 'awiil ii in <unk> this was the last monument erected at <unk> before the city finally fell into silence the former satellites of <unk> such as <unk> and <unk> did not last much longer <unk> their final monuments in <unk> by the end of the 9th century the vast majority of <unk> 's population had deserted the city its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple <unk> dwellings were being erected in the city 's ceremonial <unk> the squatters blocked some <unk> in the rooms they <unk> in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non @-@ <unk> items such as musical instruments these inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them some monuments were <unk> and some were moved to new locations before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers had disappeared with the tombs of the north acropolis being explored for <unk> and the easier to find tombs being looted after <num> <unk> was all but deserted although a remnant population may have survived in <unk> <unk> interspersed among the ruins even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the 10th or 11th centuries and the <unk> claimed the ruins for the next thousand years some of <unk> 's population may have migrated to the <unk> lakes region which remained heavily populated in spite of a <unk> in population levels in the first half of the 9th century <stop>
<start> the most likely cause of collapse at <unk> is <unk> and agrarian failure the fall of <unk> was a blow to the heart of classic maya civilization the city having been at the forefront of courtly life art and architecture for over a thousand years with an ancient ruling dynasty however new research regarding <unk> <unk> from the <unk> reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment of <unk> <stop>

<start> german courts have so far not resolved whether scientology should be accorded the legal status of a religious or <unk> community and different courts have reached contradictory conclusions the german domestic intelligence service has monitored the organization 's activities the german government does not recognize scientology as a religion it views it as an abusive business <unk> as a religion and believes that it pursues political goals that conflict with the values enshrined in the german constitution this stance has been criticized most notably by the u.s. government which recognizes scientology as a religion and has raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect <unk> <stop>

<start> the german government has said that it does not consider scientology a religion but a commercial enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike of any criticism whose totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk to germany 's democratic society accordingly the german government has taken a very strong stance against the organization germany is not alone in opposing scientology in france the church of scientology was convicted of organized fraud in october <num> after a court found that members had been manipulated into paying large sums for scientology products and the church only narrowly escaped being banned altogether scientology is similarly controversial in belgium greece and the uk <stop>
<start> on the subject of scientology 's status as a religion the german government has pointed to a <num> decision by the federal labor court of germany that court noting hubbard 's instruction that scientologists should make money make more money – make other people produce so as to make more money came to the conclusion that scientology <unk> to be a church merely as a cover to pursue its economic interests in the same decision the court also found that scientology uses <unk> and totalitarian practices given the lessons of germany 's 20th @-@ century history in which the country came to be dominated by a fascist movement that started from similarly small beginnings germany is very wary of any ideological movement that might appear to be seeking a position of absolute power <unk> in scientology writings to the elimination of parasites and <unk> people who stand in the way of progress towards scientology 's <unk> world without <unk> without criminals and without war evoke uncomfortable parallels with nazism and have led to scientology being classified as an <unk> political movement <stop>
<start> to further justify its stance the german government has also pointed to the long history of u.s. court cases involving scientology including the conviction of <num> top scientologists in <num> and <num> for a conspiracy involving the infiltration of u.s. government agencies <unk> and the theft of government documents a <num> u.s. supreme court finding that scientology practices took place in a <unk> environment and scientology 's track record of pursuing its critics through malicious court cases and private investigators in examining the potential threat posed by scientology the german government has noted that scientology organizations are structured so as to make the individual <unk> and financially dependent on a scientology system and that members often abandon contact with friends and family <stop>

<start> the <unk> final record in rugby matches was <num> wins <num> draws and <num> losses they introduced a number of tactical innovations to new zealand rugby on their return home and their tour contributed to the formation of the new zealand rugby football union in <num> seventeen of the team 's <num> players went on to play <unk> in new zealand and two thomas <unk> and david <unk> subsequently captained the new zealand national rugby team <stop>
<start> the idea for assembling a team of māori footballers to tour britain was conceived by joseph <unk> a rugby player who had toured with the first new zealand national team in <num> he initially proposed a team of māori or part @-@ māori to play the touring british side in <num> this developed into a venture to have a māori team tour britain if a preliminary tour of new zealand were successful <unk> of <unk> 's plans civil servant thomas <unk> contacted him to offer help managing the tour which <unk> accepted when james scott a <unk> subsequently joined the partnership the three men decided that <unk> would be the team 's captain scott its manager and <unk> its promoter <stop>
<start> <unk> started assembling a team for the tour in early <num> he had difficulties assembling a squad due to player availability and failed to secure the talented jack <unk> due to his university commitments some māori players who initially agreed to play later pulled out when the eligibility criteria were relaxed to allow squad members who were only part @-@ māori twenty māori or part @-@ māori players joined the squad five <unk> white new zealand players were added after the team lost to auckland due to the inclusion of these <unk> players the team was renamed from the new zealand <unk> to the new zealand native football representatives the final squad comprised <num> players including <unk> of these at least five were full @-@ <unk> māori while fourteen had a māori mother and a <unk> father the parentage of some of the players is unknown <stop>

<start> the team were met in britain by local rugby administrators including an official of england 's rugby football union rfu the first match of the tour was against surrey where the team became the first new zealand side to perform a <unk> and also the first to wear an all black uniform that the team was predominantly māori provoked curiosity from the british press – at the time most britons had not seen non @-@ white people – but there was some surprise that the team were not as māori as had been expected they are not unlike europeans a scottish reporter wrote in november <num> that is their resemblance is great when one remembers that they were a savage tribe no further back than a generation the surrey match which was <unk> by the rfu secretary george rowland hill was won <num> – <num> by the <unk> after they scored two tries <stop>
<start> the <unk> next defeated both <unk> and kent before defeats by <unk> and burton @-@ on @-@ trent both defeats were unexpected and in the <unk> match injuries played a part – the tourists played most of the match at least two men down as replacements were then not allowed the team recovered to win their next game against midlands counties in birmingham their next fixture was against middlesex in a match not open to the public and hosted by the earl of sheffield at sheffield park <unk> the middlesex side contained a number of international players including arthur gould middlesex won easily with the <unk> play characterised by poor tackling the final score was <num> – <num> with three tries conceded by the new zealanders prior to the match both sides had enjoyed lunch with wine – an indulgence the <unk> were not used to a report in the auckland star had this to say of the game <stop>
<start> the new zealanders expected to meet a mere exhibition <num> of scratch players whereas mr rowland hill had carefully collected the best possible team available such passing as the home men displayed the <unk> <unk> admit they have never previously witnessed said <unk> whilst we were on the platform waiting for the london train i think they would have just beaten us even if we had been in good form <stop>

<start> the ireland fixture was played at lansdowne road dublin on <num> december <num> both teams had a number of leading players out injured – the irish were forced to make four changes to their original selection ireland led <num> – <num> at half @-@ time after scoring a converted try but the <unk> improved considerably in the second @-@ half scoring four tries patrick <unk> scored the first two tries and his play was praised by the local press the third try scored was by thomas <unk> after a counter @-@ attack by george williams the try was not converted but the strong finish from the new zealanders gave the visitors a <num> – <num> victory the irish press were surprised by the loss and strongly criticised their team but ireland did go on to defeat wales two tries to nil in the <num> home nations championship following their defeat of ireland the <unk> played trinity college and then north of ireland the match against trinity college was drawn <num> – <num> and despite <unk> not playing the native side played much better than their previous fixture the team then travelled to belfast where they defeated north of ireland <num> – <num> on <num> december scoring two tries to nil <stop>
<start> after returning to england the <unk> faced lancashire in manchester where they lost <num> – <num> two days later they drew with <unk> bulldogs despite their opposition scoring five tries their next match was against yorkshire who were one of the strongest counties in the country and went on to win the inaugural county championship that season yorkshire fielded a weakened team and were subsequently defeated <num> – <num> by the <unk> who scored six tries after a further two victories the team travelled to wales where they lost <num> – <num> to <unk> before facing wales on <num> december <stop>
<start> at the start of the match the home crowd were fairly hostile towards the welsh team due to fans of both swansea and <unk> feeling slighted by the lack of selection of their players four teams dominated welsh international selection at the time and out of the <num> @-@ man team only william towers and william bowen of swansea and dan <unk> of <unk> had been selected the match was played in swansea and the lack of local players may have contributed to a poor crowd with gate receipts of only £ <num> recorded the crowd 's hostility impacted on the players and <unk> norman <unk> was <unk> nervous at the start of the match <unk> aged <num> years and <num> days became the youngest welsh international player – a record he held until the debut of tom <unk> in <num> despite the <unk> aimed primarily at <unk> charlie arthur and george thomas the welsh team produced an excellent effort especially from the forwards <stop>
<start> towers scored the first welsh try which was converted by jim webb the <unk> replied with a spirited run by <unk> but he failed to break through the welsh defence the tourists trailed even further after george thomas scored a <unk> try <unk> the half @-@ way line which went some way to silence the <unk> from the crowd webb playing in out of position at full @-@ back missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark the <unk> continued to push with elliot coming within five @-@ yards of the try line and when <unk> did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the <num> @-@ yard line before he could touch down in the second half wales continued to push their advantage when alexander <unk> <unk> the ball into the <unk> <num> this was collected by sydney nicholls who managed to get the ball across the try line allowing jim <unk> to score <unk> for the <unk> and <unk> for wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries but there were no further scores in the game <stop>
<start> the match was also of historical importance because of the welsh tactics employed in the <num> home nations championship wales had <unk> the four three @-@ quarter system wherein the team would play with eight forwards rather than nine and instead employ an extra centre three @-@ quarter the system was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star welsh player arthur gould whose formidable ability as a back allowed his club team newport to retain the additional forward with gould working in the west indies wales again tried the four three @-@ quarter system against the <unk> and its success saw the team permanently adopt the system within six years the other three home countries had adopted four three @-@ quarter style of play <stop>
<start> before they left wales the <unk> played swansea and two other local clubs newport and cardiff they defeated swansea for their first win in wales and followed this up with a victory over newport in front of <num> @,@ <num> spectators they finished their welsh matches and the year with a <num> – <num> loss to cardiff in front of a partisan crowd <stop>

<start> after a victory over <unk> valley district the team travelled west to play <unk> devonshire taunton and gloucestershire and won all five games the victory over somerset was the new zealanders largest of the tour they scored nine tries in a <num> – <num> victory half @-@ back <unk> played outstandingly for the <unk> while the entire side demonstrated superior passing and combination to their opposition devonshire and <unk> suffered heavy defeats by the new zealanders before a strong gloucestershire side was dismissed after defeating midland counties the <unk> returned to london <stop>
<start> the team had two further matches before their international against england the first was against one of the strongest clubs in england <unk> andrew <unk> who had toured new zealand and australia with the <num> british isles side played for the club in their <num> – <num> defeat to the <unk> the new zealanders won having scored four tries including two by <unk> their next opposition was a united services side mainly comprising royal navy players the <unk> were again victorious this time <num> – <num> the match against oxford university was postponed due to heavy <unk> and so the team had a seven @-@ day break from playing – their longest of the tour <stop>
<start> the match against england was causing the <unk> players and management problems before it had even begun the team manager scott was in dispute with the rfu over where the match should be played – the rfu were adamant that the match should take place at <unk> 's ground but scott wanted the game to proceed at the oval where a larger crowd and therefore higher gate receipts could be secured the strictly amateur rfu establishment were already suspicious of the profit @-@ making motives of the <unk> and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue the rfu was also in dispute with the other home <unk> over the formation of the international rugby football board <unk> following a disputed try in an england – scotland international match in <num> the scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game but the rfu insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote arguing that they deserved this as they were they asserted the senior body and had the most member clubs ireland wales and scotland consequently refused to play against england until <num> when following arbitration the rfu relented and joined the <unk> the absence of international matches was a factor in england agreeing to face the <unk> on <num> february <num> <stop>
<start> the line @-@ ups selected for the <num> february match were both strong and close to full strength though <num> of the england side had not played internationally before all were experienced at domestic level the match was <unk> by rowland hill who had also <unk> the <unk> first match in britain against surrey the opening of the first half was a scoreless affair with much tackling and <unk> on the heavy ground later in the half england scored two tries through harry bedford but both were disputed by the <unk> who claimed that one of their players had grounded the ball in @-@ goal england took the two @-@ try advantage into the second half <stop>
<start> early in the second half a third disputed try was scored by the english the try and its aftermath caused controversy and a rift between the <unk> and the rfu <unk> attempted to tackle the english player <unk> and in the process ripped his shorts off the <unk> quickly formed a circle around <unk> to allow him to replace his clothing without being seen while this was happening one of the english players frank <unk> picked up the ball and scored a try the new zealanders protested believing that play had stopped after claiming <unk> had called dead ball – but hill awarded the try prompting three of the native players dick <unk> williams and <unk> <unk> to leave the field in protest the <unk> players were eventually persuaded to return but not before hill had <unk> play <unk> was very critical of hill particularly because he was also secretary of the rfu <unk> wrote after the tour that gross as these errors were they were insignificant when compared with another that mr hill committed at the outset of the game <unk> <unk> at all in that game the disputed try was followed by a final try for the english who ultimately won <num> – <num> <stop>
<start> the rfu at hill 's instigation promptly demanded an apology from the <unk> captain of the day edward <unk> who had led the team as joe <unk> was injured the english authorities of the time believed that the decision of a referee was above question and that protesting a decision as the new zealanders had done was unsportsmanlike the rfu threatened to bar any of their affiliated players – in other words the entire rugby playing population of england – from facing the <unk> if they did not <unk> <unk> swiftly sent an apology by telegram but this was deemed inadequate he therefore sent another four days after the game <stop>
<start> the london establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the new zealanders approach to the game reports of rough and over @-@ aggressive play by the <unk> had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in britain in the north of england criticism of the visitors <unk> was rarer the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south some of the <unk> including joe <unk> accused the rfu and the english press of hypocrisy claiming that they were quick to <unk> the new zealanders for rough play yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players <stop>
<start> the <unk> remained in london following the england international they defeated london welsh on <num> february before losing first to cambridge then oxford university from there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to leigh after a win over <unk> there was a defeat to oldham played on a ground <unk> said was so frozen it was dangerous after reversing their previous loss to halifax with a <num> – <num> win the <unk> suffered a loss to barrow and district on <num> march the new zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a <num> – <num> draw with hull <unk> were then defeated for the second time in two weeks in the tourists last match in northern england <stop>
<start> the team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in britain they eventually played southern counties and beat them <num> – <num> this was their <unk> match in the british isles and their 49th victory the authorities and press in london continued to view the team negatively and the <unk> boarded ship without a formal farewell this perceived <unk> from the rfu provoked some criticism from the press outside london as well as from the team manager scott who felt that with the team 's official apology after the england match the controversy should have put to rest <stop>
<start> the majority of the <unk> left plymouth on <num> march <unk> and pie <unk> followed a week later they arrived in melbourne in may where the team played mostly victorian rules football hoping to make more money that way although the side had employed jack <unk> to coach them in victorian rules during their tour of the british isles the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training as a result the victorian rules matches were a failure the players <unk> with the rules combined with the fact that most of the <unk> were rugby forwards and therefore less suited to the more open victorian rules ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds the side played nine victorian rules matches in total including one in new south wales but won only three of them all against relatively weak opposition <stop>
<start> the side 's success in their rugby matches contrasted to their failure in victorian rules – the new zealanders played three rugby matches while in victoria against melbourne a navy selection and victoria the matches were all won with their game against victoria a <num> – <num> victory after this they left for sydney for further rugby matches and defeated new south wales <num> – <num> after two further victories the side again faced new south wales and won the match <num> – <num> another two victories followed before the team played their only association football matches of the tour – both defeats <stop>
<start> the team travelled north to queensland where as in new south wales rugby was the dominant code of football consequently the team exclusively played rugby while in the region the <unk> faced queensland at the association ground in brisbane the <num> spectators witnessed the new zealanders overwhelm the <unk> to win <num> – <num> the <unk> did not exert themselves in the win and the score did not reflect their dominance after a further two matches against <unk> and ipswich both of whom were comfortably defeated the team returned to brisbane for a rematch with queensland in contrast to their first meeting the first @-@ half was a close affair and the two sides were tied at the conclusion of the half billy <unk> suffered a kick to the head and had to retire early in the second @-@ half following the loss of <unk> the play of the <unk> improved and they recovered to win <num> – <num> not long after the game concluded rumours circulated that some of the players had been offered ₤ <num> by <unk> to throw the game <unk> later said <stop>
<start> it was on the occasion of this match that four of our players were thought in racing <unk> to be playing stiff and that they had been got by some <unk> at all events when accused of it at half @-@ time and cautioned they played a different game in the second half <stop>
<start> the response from the team 's management was to suspend four players the team travelled to <unk> where they defeated the locals <num> – <num> the <unk> included a replacement player for only the second time charles <unk> after the <unk> reduced the playing strength of the side the team then travelled back to new zealand and arrived in <unk> on <num> august <stop>
<start> two days after their return the <unk> faced <unk> who they defeated <num> – <num> in front of a crowd of <num> @,@ <num> the side suffered further injury to harry lee and recruited <unk> w. <unk> for their match against <unk> district on <num> august despite playing the match two players down the <unk> comfortably defeated <unk> <num> – <num> following the side 's return to new zealand the <unk> rugby football union demanded that the team 's management explain the accusations levelled at them in queensland <unk> responded by insisting that the players had only been suspended while an investigation was conducted and that the management was confident no wrongdoing had occurred the northern rugby union since renamed queensland rugby union summarised the incident and aftermath in the <num> queensland rugby union annual <stop>
<start> ... it was apparent to a judge of the game that something was wrong with the <unk> as they were not showing their usual dash and combination four members of the team were suspended a charge being made against them of attempting the sell the match the matter was bought before the <unk> union who passed the following resolution that having heard all available evidence regarding the charges against certain members of the native team and having received an explicit denial of charges from the accused members and a satisfactory explanation from the management we are of opinion that there are no facts before us <unk> the allegations ... <stop>
<start> it is unlikely given the attitude of the <unk> rugby union to the <unk> before their departure that they would have dismissed the allegations if <unk> evidence had existed the side was back to full strength following the return of their suspended players when the side faced <unk> in <unk> the <unk> <unk> their opponents five tries to two and won <num> – <num> the side 's star player and half @-@ back <unk> stayed in <unk> when the team departed for <unk> the side faced <unk> 's bay who were touring in <unk> and <unk> defeated them <num> – <num> the <unk> play was praised by the press ... the <unk> of the black passed with remarkable accuracy and <unk> between their legs over their shoulders under their arms and with their feet the side then faced canterbury on <num> august who they <unk> <num> – <num> the report published in the press said of the <unk> performance <stop>
<start> the play showed on saturday afternoon was a fine exhibition of what several months of combination and practice will do ... it must be admitted they were far and away too good for our local men in the loose in the <unk> <unk> passing <unk> or running they were very much indeed canterbury 's superior such runs as were made by <unk> at full back by madigan <unk> and w. <unk> the passing of h. <unk> f. <unk> and all the backs as well as several forwards the rushes of <unk> <unk> maynard <unk> <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> powers of nearly every one <unk> their opponents ... <stop>
<start> the side left <unk> and travelled north where they played <unk> in masterton the match was won <num> – <num> and the next day they faced wellington who they also defeated the fixture against wellington was nearly abandoned because scott and the wellington rugby union could not agree on a venue the match went ahead only when the wellington officials agreed to cede the <unk> all profit from the match after this the <unk> travelled to auckland where they played their last match against the province on <num> august the match was lost <num> – <num> after each team scored two tries each but the <unk> kicked a drop @-@ goal and a conversion the loss ended a remarkable run of matches – the <unk> had a <num> @-@ game unbeaten streak in rugby matches that started with their victory over <unk> on <num> march the side won <num> and drew one match between the defeats <stop>
<start> the tour had a significant impact on the development of rugby within new zealand it was the first tour of the british isles by a team from the southern hemisphere and the longest in the history of the sport by the time the <unk> returned to new zealand they had developed into a side superior to any in the country and introduced a number of tactical innovations seventeen of the <num> players went on to play <unk> in new zealand and two <unk> and david <unk> subsequently captained new zealand <stop>
<start> the tour also prompted the eventual formation of the new zealand rugby football union <unk> later renamed new zealand rugby union in <num> one reason for its formation was to ensure greater control over any future touring new zealand sides the <unk> sent an officially sanctioned new zealand team captained by <unk> to tour australia in <num> the <unk> are also the <unk> of the māori all blacks a representative team organised by the <unk> that first played in <num> the native team along with joe <unk> was inducted into the irb hall of fame in <num> – the seventh <unk> <stop>

<start> general clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on june <num> an attempt to <unk> the channel between the two islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder @-@ deep too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition he considered using boats to ferry the troops across but the americans with timely advice from general lee adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the long island position as a result the british and american forces faced each other across the channel engaging in occasional and largely <unk> cannon fire at long range clinton reported that this meant that admiral parker would have the glory of being defeated alone the attack was originally planned for june <num> but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted parker to call it off for several days <stop>
<start> on the morning of june <num> fort sullivan was defended by colonel <unk> commanding the 2nd south carolina regiment and a company of the 4th south carolina artillery numbering <num> men at around <num> <num> am that morning a british ship fired a signal gun indicating all was ready for the attack less than an hour later nine warships had sailed into positions facing the fort thunder and friendship anchored about <num> @.@ <num> miles <num> @.@ <num> km from the fort while parker took active bristol experiment and <unk> to a closer position about <num> yards <num> m from sullivan 's island where they anchored facing broadside to the fort each of these ships began to fire upon the fort when it reached its position and the defenders returned the fire although many of thunder 's shots landed in or near the fort they had little effect according to <unk> we had a <unk> in the middle that swallowed them up instantly and those that fell in the sand in and about the fort were immediately buried thunder 's role in the action was also relatively short @-@ lived she had anchored too far away from the fort and the <unk> of her mortars with extra powder to increase their range eventually led to them breaking out of their mounts owing to shortage of gunpowder <unk> 's men were deliberate in the pace of their gunfire and only a few officers actually aimed the cannons they also fired in small <unk> four cannon at a time one british observer wrote their fire was surprisingly well served and it was slow but decisive indeed they were very cool and took care not to fire except their guns were exceedingly well directed <stop>
<start> general clinton began movements to cross over to the northern end of sullivan 's island <unk> by two <unk> of war the flotilla of <unk> carrying his troops came under fire from colonel william thomson 's defenses facing a withering barrage of grape shot and rifle fire clinton abandoned the attempt <stop>
<start> around noon the frigates <unk> <unk> and <unk> were sent on a roundabout route avoiding some <unk> to take a position from which they could enfilade the fort 's main firing platform and also cover one of the main escape routes from the fort however all three ships grounded on an <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> became entangled in the process the british managed to <unk> <unk> and <unk> but <unk> remained grounded having moved too far onto the submerged <unk> consequently none of these ships reached its intended position a piece of good fortune not lost on colonel <unk> had these three ships effected their purpose they would have <unk> us in such a manner as to have driven us from our guns <stop>
<start> at the fort <unk> ordered his men to concentrate their fire on the two large man @-@ of @-@ war ships bristol and experiment which took hit after hit from the fort 's guns chain shot fired at bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the <unk> and <unk> one round hit her quarterdeck slightly wounding parker in the knee and thigh the shot also tore off part of his <unk> leaving his <unk> exposed by mid @-@ afternoon the defenders were running out of gunpowder and their fire was briefly suspended however lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland and the defenders resumed firing at the british ships lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day telling colonel <unk> i see you are doing very well here you have no occasion for me i will go up to the town again admiral parker eventually sought to destroy the fort 's walls with persistent broadside <unk> this strategy failed due to the <unk> nature of the <unk> wood used in its constructions the structure would <unk> and it absorbed the <unk> rather than <unk> the exchange continued until around <num> <num> pm when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities and the fleet finally withdrew out of range <stop>
<start> at one point during the battle the flag <unk> had designed and raised over the fort was shot down sergeant william jasper reportedly ran to the <unk> and raised the flag again holding it up and <unk> the troops until a flag stand could be provided he was credited by <unk> with reviving the troops spirits and later given <unk> for bravery a painting of this event pictured above depicts jasper 's actions <stop>

<start> during hu 's lifetime the ming dynasty which had ruled china for over <num> years was overthrown and replaced by china 's last imperial dynasty the qing following the fall of the capital beijing in <num> remnants of the imperial family and a few ministers set up a ming loyalist regime in <unk> with zhu <unk> on the throne as the <unk> emperor hu who was noted for his seal @-@ carving and facility with seal script created a seal for the new emperor the court offered him the position of <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as a reward but he did not accept the role although he did accord himself the title of <unk> <unk> in some of his subsequent personal seals <stop>
<start> according to <unk> <unk> 's lost history of the south <unk> <unk> <unk> prior to the qing invasion of <unk> hu studied at the national university there and whilst a student was employed by the ministry of <unk> to record official <unk> he produced the imperial promotion of minor learning qin ban <unk> <unk> and the record of <unk> <unk> <unk> ji <unk> as part of this work as a result he was promoted to the ministry of personnel and gained <unk> to the <unk> academy but before he could take up this appointment beijing had fallen to the <unk> rebellion since contemporaneous biographies <unk> 's work was not published until <num> make no mention of these events it has been suggested that they were fabricated after hu 's death <stop>

<start> hu 's work was known outside his local area zhou <unk> a poet who lived in <unk> around the same time as hu and was a noted art <unk> stated in his biography of seal @-@ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that hu creates miniature stone carvings with ancient seal inscriptions for travellers to fight over and treasure implying that his carvings were popular with visitors and travellers passing through <unk> <stop>
<start> in <num> hu took it upon himself to create a new imperial seal for the <unk> emperor which he carved after a period of <unk> and prayer he presented his creation with an essay the great <unk> of the seal <unk> <unk> <unk> in which he <unk> the loss of the <unk> emperor 's seal and <unk> heaven 's favour in restoring it hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it in the form of rhyming equally @-@ footed couplets <unk> <unk> used in the imperial examinations but his submission and the seal itself were nevertheless both accepted by the southern ming court <stop>
<start> despite his reputation as an artist and seal @-@ <unk> hu was primarily a publisher his publishing house the ten <unk> studio produced reference works on calligraphy poetry and art medical textbooks books on etymology and <unk> and copies of as well as commentaries on the confucian classics unlike other publishers in the area the ten <unk> studio did not publish works of narrative fiction such as plays or novels this bias towards academia was likely a consequence of the studio 's location the mountain on which hu took up residence was just to the north of the <unk> <unk> national academy which provided a captive market for academic texts between <num> and <num> the ten <unk> studio produced over twenty printed books of this kind aimed at a wealthy literary audience the studio 's earliest publications were medical textbooks the first of which <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was published in <num> and proved popular enough to be reissued ten years later hu 's brother <unk> was a medical <unk> and appears to have been the author of these books <stop>

<start> the ming dynasty had seen considerable advancement in the process of colour printing in china at his studio hu <unk> experimented with various forms of <unk> printing creating processes for producing multi @-@ coloured prints and <unk> printed designs as a result he was able to produce some of china 's first printed publications in colour using a block printing technique known as <unk> block printing <unk> <unk> <unk> this system made use of multiple blocks each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour it was a lengthy <unk> process requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy <unk> and impressions to create a single image hu also employed a related form of multiple @-@ block printing called set @-@ block printing <unk> <unk> <unk> which had existed since the yuan period some <num> years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again he refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for <unk> some of the ink off the blocks before printing this enabled him to achieve <unk> and <unk> of shades which were not previously possible <stop>
<start> in some images hu employed a blind <unk> technique known as <unk> designs <unk> <unk> or <unk> blocks <unk> <unk> using an <unk> <unk> block to stamp designs onto paper he used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for highlights on water or plants this was a relatively new process having been invented by hu 's contemporary wu <unk> who was also a <unk> @-@ based publisher wu had used this technique for the first time in his book wisteria studio <unk> paper <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> published in <unk> both hu and wu used <unk> to create decorative writing papers the sale of which provided a <unk> income for the ten <unk> studio <stop>
<start> hu 's most notable work is the ten <unk> studio manual of painting and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an anthology of around <num> prints by around thirty different artists including hu himself published in <num> it consists of eight sections covering calligraphy bamboo flowers rocks birds and animals plums orchids and fruit some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes as well as a collection of artworks it was also intended as an artistic <unk> with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for <unk> to copy although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo the book still remains the first example of a <unk> and analytical approach to chinese painting in this book hu used his multiple @-@ block printing methods to obtain <unk> of colour in the images rather than obvious outlines or overlaps the manual is bound in the butterfly binding <unk> <unk> <unk> style whereby whole @-@ <unk> illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double @-@ page spread this binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image cambridge university library released a complete digital scan of the manual including all writings and illustrations in august <num> said charles <unk> head of the cambridge university chinese department the binding is so fragile and the manual so delicate that until it was <unk> we have never been able to let anyone look through it or study it – despite its <unk> importance to scholars <stop>
<start> this volume went on to influence colour printing across china where it paved the way for the later but better @-@ known manual of the <unk> <unk> garden <unk> <unk> <unk> and also in japan where it was reprinted and foreshadowed the development in <unk> @-@ e of the colour <unk> printing process known as <unk> @-@ e <unk> the popularity of the ten <unk> studio manual was such that print runs continued to be produced all the way through to the late qing dynasty <stop>

<start> the battle of the <unk> river took place during the second world war and involved australian new zealand and japanese forces part of the wider <unk> campaign of the pacific theatre the battle was fought in the southern sector of <unk> island coming after the battle of <unk> 's knoll in which a strong japanese counterattack was defeated the battle occurred in two distinct periods between <num> april and <num> may <num> as elements of the australian 15th brigade advanced south along the <unk> road <stop>
<start> the initial phase saw the australians advance towards the <unk> river following the end of the early fighting the australian advance towards the main japanese concentration at <unk> continued as they struck out towards the <unk> and <unk> rivers this continued until torrential rain and flooding brought the advance to a halt short of the objective <unk> away many bridges and roads upon which the australians relied for supplies as the australian advance stalled the japanese began harassing the australian line of communications and as the rain stopped and the flooding subsided in late @-@ july and into august the australians began making preparations to resume the advance towards <unk> again ultimately though the war came to an end before the final australian advance began bringing the campaign to an end <stop>

<start> us marines conducted an amphibious landing at cape <unk> on the western coast of the island north of empress augusta bay in november <num> after an initial counter @-@ attack the us marines had been replaced by a garrison of us army troops who began consolidating their position around <unk> establishing a strong perimeter in march <num> the japanese launched a heavy counter @-@ attack which was turned back with heavy casualties after this the situation on <unk> became largely static as the japanese focused primarily on subsistence and the us forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining the perimeter around <unk> <stop>
<start> in late <num> as part of plans to free us troops up for the philippines campaign the australian ii corps — consisting of mainly militia troops under the command of lieutenant general stanley <unk> — took over responsibility for allied operations on <unk> from the american xiv corps australian forces began arriving on the island between november and december <num> initially establishing themselves around the us base at <unk> due to inaccurate intelligence <unk> mistakenly believed that the japanese forces on the island numbered just <num> @,@ <num> men and he consequently decided that the australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the japanese from <unk> in order to free their troops for subsequent operations elsewhere rather than maintaining the defensive posture the us forces had adopted however allied estimates of japanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after the war it was found that the number of japanese on the island at this time was closer to <num> @,@ <num> <stop>
<start> the campaign that australian planners developed entailed three separate drives in the north it was planned that japanese forces would be forced into the narrow <unk> peninsula and contained in the centre the seizure of pearl ridge would give the australians control of the east – west avenues of approach as well as <unk> them protection against further counter @-@ attacks while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast and the main campaign in the south where the bulk of the japanese forces were concentrated around <unk> <stop>
<start> following the capture of pearl ridge in december <num> the australian 7th brigade had been moved south and allocated to the drive towards <unk> in late march and early april <num> they had fought the battle of <unk> 's knoll after which a brief lull followed as the australians paused to shorten their supply lines meanwhile the survivors of the japanese force heavily demoralised by their defeat withdrew towards the <unk> river the australian 3rd division was then ordered to resume its advance south being tasked with capturing the <unk> river while the <unk> was also included as an intermediate objective japanese strength in the southern sector was estimated by the australians at about <num> @,@ <num> men of which <num> @,@ <num> were believed to be directly opposing the 3rd division the 15th brigade was considered to be the most experienced of the australian units on <unk> at the time and was moved up to relieve the 7th brigade which was in need of rest <stop>
<start> under the command of brigadier <unk> <unk> the 15th brigade consisted of three infantry battalions as well as two troops of tanks from the <num> 4th armoured regiment engineers from the 15th field company a battery of <num> @-@ mm guns from u heavy battery field artillery from the 2nd field regiment and a number of smaller support units the <unk> 59th infantry battalion took over responsibility for <unk> 's knoll replacing the 25th infantry battalion while the 24th infantry battalion took up a position across the <unk> road the brigade 's third battalion — the 57th 60th infantry battalion — did not join them until the beginning of may and so the 7th brigade 's 9th infantry battalion continued patrolling operations north of the <unk> river in the <unk> area until the 57th 60th could dispatch elements to relieve them further inland the <num> 8th commando squadron advanced in a wide arc to the south @-@ east defending the brigade 's left or eastern flank <stop>

<start> <unk> their advance the australians were supported by three squadrons of <unk> from the royal new zealand air force — nos. <num> <num> and <num> squadrons — which bombed and <unk> the ground in front of the advancing infantry as well as a <unk> barrage of artillery and mortar fire with such strong support the japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the 24th infantry battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the <unk> for just one man wounded further progress was made over the next week but on <num> may the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun mines and other improvised explosive devices after this the 15th brigade 's engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the australian armour to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines the japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also to <unk> the effectiveness of the australian tanks the japanese began to position themselves off the roads forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support additionally the japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry which they kept under constant observation and fire <stop>
<start> meanwhile the previous day <num> may the 57th 60th infantry battalion had begun operating along the parallel commando road to the north here they had a number of encounters and suffered casualties due to their inexperience in patrolling which resulted in them being ambushed they also kept up a steady advance and eventually beat the main force in reaching and crossing the river arriving there on <num> may on <num> may along the <unk> road the 24th infantry battalion had pressed forward again <unk> with a tank troop in support they came up against a concealed field gun defended by approximately <num> japanese after the lead matilda 's machine gun jammed the field gun opened fire on it damaging it and wounding its crew moving around the stricken tank the second matilda armed with a howitzer opened fire and destroyed the field gun before sweeping the japanese defenders from the position that night the japanese artillery opened up on the australian position with a heavy barrage and the following morning put in a company @-@ sized counter @-@ attack the fighting lasted for over two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours but when it was over the australians remained in possession of the position having repulsed the attack in doing so they suffered one killed and nine wounded while the attacking japanese had suffered heavily losing <num> men killed it was the biggest loss since the action at <unk> 's knoll and it spelt the end of their attempt to defend the <unk> <stop>
<start> after this the australians were able to resume their advance to the river on <num> may without further opposition the previous three weeks in which they had advanced <num> @,@ <num> yd <num> @,@ <num> m to the <unk> had been costly for them however with the australian 24th infantry battalion losing <num> killed and <num> wounded against this the japanese had lost at least <num> killed <stop>
<start> following the advance to the <unk> there was a pause of about a week as the australians had to wait for roads to be improved and supplies to be brought up before attempting to cross the <unk> en <unk> this allowed <unk> to re @-@ evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the <unk> and <unk> rivers as they waited for the advance to resume the australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into japanese held territory and there were a couple of significant engagements during this time as a part of these the 24th infantry battalion sent a company across the <unk> and subsequently located a strong japanese position on a feature that became known as <unk> 's ridge which due to its location commanded the main australian axis of advance <stop>
<start> the main crossing was planned for <num> may with the <unk> 59th infantry battalion on the right tasked to cut the <unk> road and the <unk> track to the east of the river while on the left the 57th 60th infantry battalion would divert the attention of the japanese off the 24th infantry battalion which would make the main frontal assault from the centre of the australian line crossing at the <unk> <unk> advancing straight up the <unk> road preliminary moves began before this and on <num> may a platoon from the 24th infantry battalion along with two tanks attempted to carry out an attack on <unk> 's ridge after one of the tanks was held up and knocked out by a japanese field gun they were forced to withdraw meanwhile the <unk> <unk> squadrons — now reinforced by no. <num> squadron — began an eight @-@ day aerial campaign attacking along the length of the <unk> and commando roads during this period the new zealanders flew <num> sorties while artillery and mortars fired thousands of rounds <stop>
<start> two days later on <num> may the 57th 60th infantry battalion began its diversionary move on the left flank crossing the <unk> inland and advancing along the commando road with <num> <unk> and two batteries of artillery in support crossing <num> yd <num> m north of the <unk> the centre company carried out an attack along the far bank of the river without its armoured support which had been unable to negotiate the crossing nevertheless shortly before noon they had secured the crossing and began to fan out carrying out further flanking moves before establishing a firm base to receive supplies and from where it began patrolling operations on <num> may <stop>
<start> in the centre the main attack along the <unk> road began at <num> <num> on <num> may after <num> minutes of <unk> by new zealand <unk> had prepared the ground <unk> under a <unk> barrage and with mortar and machine gun support the 24th infantry battalion moved forward with three companies up front and one held back in reserve along with two troops of matilda tanks <unk> the forward companies reached their objectives but one of the companies was halted just short of their objective and was forced to dig @-@ in overnight after coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing four killed and five wounded the attack was resumed the following day and the australians were able to advance to the <unk> <unk> however they were prevented from moving any further as the japanese were still concentrated in large numbers further to the west where an australian patrol encountered <num> japanese and were forced to go to ground finally a company from the 24th infantry battalion was able to move on to the high ground on <unk> 's ridge which they found to be heavily mined and booby trapped engineers and assault pioneers were called up to clear the feature <stop>
<start> on the right flank the <unk> 59th infantry battalion carried out a wide flanking move along a track that had been carved out of the west bank of the <unk> by <unk> beginning their move two days earlier a number of patrols had had contacts with the japanese meanwhile using <unk> to drag the tanks through the mud the australian armour had crossed the river also and by <num> <num> on <num> may the battalion had managed to establish itself in an assembly area to the east of the river <unk> to the japanese the following day the battalion left the line of departure and began to advance on its primary objective which it reached in the early afternoon despite being held up while the tanks attempted to affect a creek crossing and further delayed by stiff resistance later after one of the battalion 's patrols came under heavy fire the tanks moved up and attacked a japanese gun position which the defenders quickly abandoned leaving behind a <num> mm gun and a large amount of ammunition <stop>
<start> by <num> may although there were still a number of japanese in the area which continued to harass and ambush their line of communications most of the australian objectives had been secured and <unk> up operations began the last remaining defensive location before the <unk> was <unk> 's ridge where the japanese were sheltering in tunnels a heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them to abandon the ridge it was subsequently occupied by a company of australian infantry within a short period of time the <unk> road was subsequently opened providing the australians with the means with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign being the advance to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> rivers the final phase of the battle cost the japanese <num> killed while the australians lost <num> killed and <num> wounded <stop>
<start> during the course of the fighting around the <unk> the australians lost <num> men killed and <num> wounded while the japanese lost at least <num> men killed following the battle the australians continued their advance towards <unk> at the southern end of the island throughout the remainder of the month and into june the 15th brigade advanced along the <unk> road crossing the <unk> on <num> june beyond the river the japanese resolved to hold the food growing areas in order to protect their precarious food supply and they consequently occupied a series of deep <unk> these were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery and the 15th brigade subsequently crossed <unk> river before being relieved by brigadier noel simpson 's 29th brigade in early july <stop>
<start> as the 29th brigade advanced toward the <unk> river torrential rain and flooding ultimately brought the advance to a halt the height of the river rose <num> metres <num> @.@ <num> ft the <unk> road was reduced in the words of gavin long to a sea of mud and many of the bridges upon which the australian supply system was dependent were washed away this rendered large @-@ scale offensive infantry operations impossible and as the situation worsened for a period of time the australians even ceased patrolling operations across the <unk> meanwhile the japanese continued to harass the australians probing their positions and setting mines and traps targeting the australian line of communications on <num> july the 15th infantry battalion fought off a series of attacks around <unk> at the junction of the <unk> river and the <unk> road which included a heavy japanese artillery bombardment australian patrols were resumed in late july and continued into august these attacks proved very costly particularly amongst the australian engineers that were tasked with rebuilding the bridges and roads that had been destroyed in the flooding <stop>
<start> fighting in the northern sector continued during this time also and although preparations in the south for the final advance towards <unk> continued into august combat operations on the island ceased as the war came to an end before these were completed as a result the final australian operations on <unk> took place on the <unk> front in the northern sector where the australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at <unk> <unk> had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into the <unk> peninsula by mid @-@ august however following the dropping of two atomic bombs on <unk> and <unk> and japan 's subsequent unconditional surrender a cease fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor clashes following this it spelt an end to major combat operations <stop>

<start> <unk> developed ideas for characters an engine and gameplay mechanics development emphasized speed so <unk> eliminated character designs not associated with fast animals as well as fast creatures like <unk> and squirrels one idea a <unk> able to grasp objects with prehensile ears showed promise at first but was too complex for the available hardware the team narrowed its search to animals that can roll into a ball their idea for an attacking move <unk> then realized that this would not seem aggressive enough so they focused on two animals with spikes <unk> and <unk> the <unk> character first proposed by <unk> <unk> prevailed although the <unk> would later become the basis for mighty the <unk> who first appeared in <num> 's <unk> the hedgehog <unk> has admitted since that he created sonic 's basic design by combining felix the cat 's head with mickey mouse 's body <stop>
<start> sonic was originally <unk> @-@ colored then a light shade of blue but he was changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain backgrounds and to match the sega logo his shoes were colored red through the inspiration of michael jackson 's boots on the album cover for bad and the outfit of santa claus whom <unk> saw as the most famous character in the world sonic 's spikes were emphasized to make him look <unk> and he was given the ability to spin while jumping so attacking and jumping could be controlled with one button the new character was originally named mr. <unk> but the eight @-@ member <unk> changed his name to sonic and their studios to sonic team <unk> proposed to flesh out the character included placing him in a rock band giving him vampire fangs and giving him a human girlfriend named madonna but sega of america scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple sega of america also expressed concerns that most americans would not know what a <unk> is and initially proposed a full @-@ scale recreation of the character but compromised with sonic team to simply make design changes the antagonist ended up being named dr. <unk> in japan and dr. <unk> in other regions as a result of a dispute between sega 's american and japanese divisions <stop>

<start> <unk> 's other friend <unk> <unk> testified that <unk> 's fall happened in a break between the end of concert and the encore <unk> climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage according to him blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off while the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage <unk> fell directly on the ground according to <unk> there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break <unk> further testified that after the fall <unk> went to sit on a bench where he was <unk> a water bottle <unk> began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a <unk> at the back of his head they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion <unk> said that he understood blythe 's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage <stop>
<start> another person to testify was robert <unk> who worked as a security guard the night of the incident <unk> said that the <unk> was too close to the stage but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage he testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured he further said that the fan 's fall might have been helped by someone else perhaps the singer though he did not see it precisely <stop>
<start> blythe 's defense team attacked differences between the testimonies the witnesses gave after the incident in <num> and at the court among other things one of the witnesses originally alleged that <unk> and blythe shook hands or that one of them offered hand to another on stage however at the court hearing he testified that there was no prior contact between them blythe also argued that video evidence shown in court refuted claims about his aggressive behavior <stop>
<start> milan <unk> the fan whom blythe admitted to <unk> off the stage testified on the third day of the trial <unk> said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage <unk> testified that blythe knocked him down <unk> on him and held him down for a moment but blythe definitely did not <unk> him he also admitted that taking into account the fact that he <unk> was drunk and the way he acted blythe 's reaction was adequate he commented that he grasped the fact that he was not wanted on stage <stop>
<start> another witness who had attended the concert at the rear of the crowd testified that blythe 's behavior was standard to metal concerts saying that metal bands always put on angry and tough acts and the concert at issue was no exception she said that it was evident that blythe did not want any fans on the stage neither the two nor any other witness who took the stand that day gave a testimony as to the moment of <unk> 's fall at the end of the concert <stop>
<start> the judge also read a sworn statement from <unk> 's former producer who stated that she had not known about the incident she was aware that an ambulance was called that evening but learned about the reasons for that only later during the police investigation the court further heard that lamb of god had sent a list of security demands to the concert venue including that barriers should be placed <num> @.@ <num> metres <num> @.@ <num> ft from the stage <unk> tomáš <unk> testified that although this was not the case the band had not expressed any concerns to him either before or after the concert <stop>
<start> randy blythe was called again to the stand that day the judge first alerted him that he had the right to remain silent and can deny answering his questions the judge went again through the blythe 's testimony and with a view to the previous witness statements asked blythe whether he insists that it was milan <unk> whom blythe threw off the stage blythe responded by saying to the best of my knowledge it was milan <unk> who was coming up on stage every time <stop>
<start> also that day expert medical witness <unk> <unk> took the stand according to the prague post <unk> testified that <unk> 's cause of death was pneumonia resulting from a blow to the <unk> <unk> added that the mortality rate from this kind of injury is around <num> percent and that doctors couldn 't have done more to save the patient <unk> was initially taken to a nearby hospital less than a kilometer from the venue where the initial diagnosis took place since this hospital did not have a specialized <unk> department <unk> was transferred to another hospital after the diagnosis there <unk> underwent two operations first to tend to the injury and second to reduce pressure on brain by removing some bone <stop>
<start> finally defense asked for <unk> as a key witness fell ill the court decided to continue with the hearings the next day after which the hearings would be <unk> until march <num> <num> in order to hear the defense 's witness blythe committed to return when the trial resumed <stop>
<start> on february <num> <num> only one witness took the stand before the hearing was <unk> <unk> <unk> contacted the defense after reading about the trial in newspapers because he didn 't like the description of the situation by the previous witnesses he said he did not think blythe was aggressive that night and that fans should realize any aggressive behavior displayed onstage is just part of the show he also said that each time somebody got on the stage blythe demonstrated that they were not allowed there <unk> testified that he saw how a fan tried to reach the stage three times and that as he was preparing to stage dive somebody aided his fall from behind he had not seen anybody fall directly on the ground <unk> had trouble recalling details from the show as he had visited multiple concerts on other dates in <unk> and thus could not describe among other things the position of the <unk> <stop>
<start> the trial resumed on march <num> <num> with testimonies from expert witnesses in the fields of criminal psychology <unk> <unk> appointed by the court and <unk> <unk> <unk> appointed by the defense blythe returned to attend the hearings in person even though the presiding judge had told him that at this point they may be undertaken in his absence the two expert witnesses agreed that blythe is not aggressive nevertheless he may have issues with controlling his emotions under stress the court further heard testimonies from two <unk> one of them was a bodyguard who was present at the concert but did not see the fall he testified that when by the exit he saw two men taking a third man out of the building to fresh air he said that he was told by them that the person fell off the stage the ambulance arrived <num> – <num> minutes later <stop>
<start> another <unk> was a fan <unk> <unk> who testified that she saw blythe <unk> <unk> saying h e climbed onto the stage and when he tried to stand up blythe <unk> him according to her the <unk> was strong enough for <unk> to fall behind the front row of the fans into a place where no fans were staying at the moment she testified that <unk> fell backwards another <unk> of the concert who took the stand that day did not recall seeing any fall by the end of the concert <stop>
<start> a defense @-@ appointed expert witness in the field of <unk> testified on march <num> that <unk> could not turn <num> degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward he could not have sustained an injury to the back of his head he further said that if <unk> fell over the first row of the fans he must have been not only pushed but must have jumped himself the state attorney immediately attacked this testimony claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time as well as some of the <unk> testimonies according to which <unk> fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall the presiding judge agreed with the state attorney on some of his points <stop>
<start> in his closing speech the state attorney asked the court to <unk> blythe for <num> years claiming that even children in the kindergarten are aware that a fall from height may lead to an injury <stop>
<start> a <unk> family representative said that based on the witness testimonies the family did not believe that blythe was solely responsible he continued that he would not be <unk> the requested amount as no money could replace the loss the family has suffered he further added that daniel had died on his father 's birthday and his mother has consequently become a <unk> patient unable to work <stop>
<start> in his closing word blythe said that he did not wish to avoid any responsibility and that if he felt guilty he would have pleaded so he further commented that in case of <unk> measures would be undertaken to avoid anything similar from happening at lamb of god concerts again <stop>
<start> on march <num> <num> the court delivered a verdict according to which blythe was not <unk> liable for <unk> 's death even though he had the moral responsibility for it consequently the court dismissed the damages claim and ordered the return of blythe 's bail <stop>
<start> the court held that it was proven that blythe had thrown <unk> off the stage however blythe due to his <unk> could have mistaken <unk> for the other fan who had repeatedly gotten over the <unk> according to the court the largest part of the blame lies with the <unk> and security members judge <unk> further <unk> blythe for not having met with the <unk> family <stop>
<start> the state attorney announced that he would appeal the verdict <stop>
<start> the state attorney 's appeal was heard by a panel of three judges of the prague high court chaired by judge <unk> <unk> the hearing took place in blythe 's absence blythe 's <unk> was upheld by the panel on june <num> <num> <stop>

<start> off @-@ site the new brake wheel and <unk> were made the original brake wheel was too rotten to repair and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in <num> the original brake wheel was <num> feet <num> @.@ <num> m diameter to allow the common sails to run at their <unk> speed when the mill was modernised in <num> it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill as patent sails run at a slower speed than common sails the great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter the brake wheel was also rebuilt with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original <unk> resulting in a wheel <num> feet <num> inches <num> @.@ <num> m in diameter the opinion of professional <unk> was sought and it was decided that a scaled @-@ up version of the original brake wheel would be made but retaining the cast iron teeth segments the remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill the original iron segments were all broken so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat @-@ treated malleable cast iron when the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for <unk> <stop>
<start> the <unk> was made some of the small <unk> were replaced the stocks were made from pitch pine and the <unk> from douglas fir work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows with only one window still needing attention when the first work @-@ in began new beech <unk> were fitted to the crown wheel which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft <stop>
<start> the stocks and sails were made during the two work @-@ ins held in july and august a total of <num> people attending over the two weeks a second @-@ hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use thus two new stocks were required instead of one modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and <unk> grounds leaving two options traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber or <unk> stocks good quality pitch pine was not <unk> in the lengths required douglas fir was <unk> in such lengths but was discounted on strength and <unk> grounds a douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had <unk> after only seven years thus it was decided that <unk> stocks would be made <stop>
<start> the <num> feet <num> @.@ <num> m long stocks were made from douglas fir all timber had been pressure treated with <unk> and well <unk> it was estimated that a <unk> stock would be up to <num> stronger than a similar stock of solid timber the timber used was <num> <num> ⁄ <num> inches <num> mm thick and nine <unk> were required at the centre where the stock passes through the poll end of the <unk> <unk> attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber both stocks were made during the work @-@ in with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use the stocks were the first <unk> stocks made by amateurs <stop>
<start> the four sails were made the originals being slightly different pairs those on the inner stock having bays of <num> feet <num> mm pitch and those on the outer stock having bays of <num> feet <num> inches <num> mm pitch it was decided that the new sails would be identical at the larger pitch four <num> feet <num> @.@ <num> m long <unk> were cut from a <unk> of pitch pine obtained from a demolished <unk> at bury st <unk> the <unk> are <num> inches <num> mm square at their inner end <unk> bars and <unk> were made from modern pitch pine selected for quality the <unk> for the sail bars were cut that at the heel of the sail being at <num> ° and that at the tip being <num> ° decreasing by <num> ½ ° at each sail bar three of the four sails had been completed at the end of the work in <stop>
<start> the <unk> and associated <unk> was fitted to the mill at the end of the second work @-@ in the cap could be turned by means of the hand <unk> the <unk> itself with the <unk> painted red white and blue was installed shortly afterwards the <unk> arm brake wheel was assembled around the <unk> it was found that the <unk> was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch <num> mm when this was corrected the brake wheel was within <num> <num> <unk> of an inch less than <num> mm of true the <unk> for the stocks were <unk> from a <unk> of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors cleaning and painting <unk> and further <unk> on the brickwork the four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the second work @-@ in the stock with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the <unk> and when <unk> in position and the <unk> had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock the process was repeated for the second pair of sails the mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work @-@ in <stop>
<start> work later in the year included the finishing of the fourth sail balancing the <unk> and sorting out <unk> troubles with the <unk> <unk> the brake and brake lever were made and installed and <unk> <unk> for the sails were cast <stop>

<start> <unk> mill is open to the public on easter monday the sunday of the late may and august bank holidays and the first sunday in july august and september it is also open at other times by prior arrangement <stop>
<start> <unk> mouth is the first segment of the 18th episode of the second season or the 38th overall episode of the american animated television series <unk> <unk> the episode was directed by andrew <unk> and was written by walt <unk> paul <unk> and <unk> williams <unk> and <unk> also served as storyboard directors and carson <unk> william <unk> and erik <unk> worked as storyboard artists it originally aired on <unk> in the united states on september <num> <num> <stop>
<start> the series follows the adventures and <unk> of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of <unk> <unk> in this episode <unk> reads a bad word off a <unk> behind the <unk> <unk> but does not know what it means patrick explains to him that it is a sentence <unk> which is used when you want to talk fancy the two start using it in every sentence they speak however when mr. <unk> hears them he warns the two never to use the word again or any of the <num> bad words later on <unk> accidentally swears again patrick then runs to tell mr. <unk> with <unk> trying to stop him however when mr. <unk> accidentally <unk> his toe he <unk> all the <num> bad words the two cannot believe it and run to mama <unk> to tell on him mama <unk> who is <unk> by their use of the words makes the three paint her house as punishment <stop>
<start> the episode received positive reviews while various members of the <unk> <unk> crew consider the episode to be one of their favorites mainly due to the satirical nature of the episode however the episode was not immune to negative reception and was criticized by <unk> media group the parents television council and fans who interpreted the episode as an example of promoting and implicitly <unk> use of <unk> towards children <stop>
<start> when <unk> goes around to the back of the <unk> <unk> to take out the trash he reads some words written on a <unk> <unk> asks patrick what is it and patrick says that the word is a sentence <unk> which is used when you want to talk fancy the next day <unk> walks into the <unk> <unk> and says the word to patrick and then over the <unk> the <unk> <unk> customers are <unk> by <unk> 's use of his word and leave <unk> then informs mr. <unk> who then decides to tell them that they were using <unk> and mentions that there are <num> <unk> words they should not use <unk> and patrick vow mr. <unk> that they will never use <unk> words again <stop>
<start> later they play their favorite game <unk> and <unk> patrick always gets <unk> but <unk> always gets <unk> eventually he loses the game and accidentally <unk> the <unk> word patrick then races to the <unk> <unk> to tell mr. <unk> with <unk> trying to stop him <unk> bursts through the front door and tells mr. <unk> that patrick said the <unk> word patrick then joins along eventually mr. <unk> stops their <unk> explanations and takes <unk> and patrick outside and makes them paint the <unk> <unk> as punishment <stop>
<start> mr. <unk> is about to give <unk> and patrick the job but he hits his foot on a rock throws the paint away and says all <num> <unk> words while complaining about his foot being injured when <unk> and patrick hear all the <unk> words they run to mama <unk> house to tell her that mr. <unk> swears when they all reach her house they repeat the same <unk> words that mr. <unk> used this makes her faint but shortly after mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> and patrick for saying all those bad words in front of her she <unk> consciousness mama <unk> states that all three of them should be <unk> for saying all those words she then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment for saying those words at her <stop>
<start> <unk> mouth was directed by andrew <unk> and was written by walt <unk> paul <unk> and <unk> williams <unk> and <unk> also served as storyboard directors and carson <unk> william <unk> and erik <unk> worked as storyboard artists series creator stephen <unk> has described the episode plot as a classic thing all kids go through much of the storyline for the episode was inspired by the writers own experiences from childhood the episode originally aired on <unk> in the united states on september <num> <num> the episode marks the introduction of mr. <unk> mother mama <unk> who was voiced by former <unk> <unk> creative producer and current executive producer paul <unk> <stop>
<start> the writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for this episode the idea for <unk> mouth was inspired by creative director derek <unk> 's experience when i got in trouble for saying the f @-@ word in front of my mother <unk> said the scene where patrick is running to mr. <unk> to <unk> with <unk> chasing him is pretty much how it happened in real life the end of the episode where mr. <unk> uses more <unk> than <unk> and patrick was also inspired by the fact that my <unk> 's mother has a sailor mouth herself <stop>
<start> the scene where <unk> and patrick playing a game of <unk> and <unk> which is a parody of <unk> and <unk> was difficult for the crew to <unk> since many shots featured certain board pieces changing location according to the series season <num> dvd commentary it was planned to have a scene that had <unk> saying go <unk> noise yourself followed by patrick saying <unk> noise you too during the <unk> and <unk> game it was removed in the final episode check because it would have been inappropriate for the younger audience <stop>
<start> <unk> mouth was released on the dvd compilation called <unk> <unk> sea stories on march <num> <num> it was also included in the <unk> <unk> the complete 2nd season dvd released on october <num> <num> on september <num> <num> <unk> mouth was released on the <unk> <unk> the first <num> episodes alongside all the episodes of seasons one through five <stop>
<start> erik <unk> a member of the <unk> <unk> crew considers <unk> mouth to be his favorite episode mainly due to its random and satirical nature saying sometimes <unk> just catches me off @-@ guard nancy <unk> of about.com ranked the episode at number two for her list of the top <num> <unk> <unk> episodes she said <unk> mouth just barely missed being in the number one slot <unk> praised the episode 's plot and called it genius ... because children can relate to the forbidden <unk> of using curse words and adults can laugh at the parody of tv censorship in an interview with paul <unk> one of the episode 's writers he told that <unk> mouth is his second favorite <unk> episode <stop>
<start> according to a report titled wolves in <unk> 's <unk> which documents the increase in potentially violent <unk> and sexual content in children 's programming the parents television council a <unk> media group and fans believed the <unk> <unk> episode <unk> mouth was an implicit attempt to promote and <unk> use of <unk> among children the episode originally aired during the <num> – <num> television season ironically the season in which the ptc named <unk> <unk> among the best programs on cable television but the report cited a repeat broadcast of the episode from <num> to prove its point that it promoted use of <unk> among children in a later report several members of the ptc listed <unk> mouth as an example of how levels of <unk> sexual and violent activity has increased in children 's television programming <unk> in response to the incident said it 's sad and a little desperate that they <unk> to literally putting <unk> language in the mouths of our characters to make a point has the fcc looked at this richard <unk> of the new york daily news criticized the report for <unk> an episode of <unk> <unk> <unk> mouth over its intent to <unk> <unk> implicitly <stop>
<start> the military history of australia spans the nation 's <num> @-@ year modern history from the early australian frontier wars between <unk> and europeans to the ongoing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan in the early 21st century although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars and war and military service have been significant influences on australian society and national identity including the anzac spirit the relationship between war and australian society has also been shaped by the enduring themes of australian strategic culture and its unique security dilemma <stop>
<start> as british <unk> the australian colonies participated in britain 's small wars of the 19th century while later as a <unk> dominion and then an independent nation australia fought in the first world war and second world war as well as in the wars in korea malaya borneo and vietnam during the cold war in the post @-@ vietnam era australian forces have been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions through the united nations and other agencies including in the sinai persian gulf <unk> somalia east timor and the solomon islands while more recently they have also fought as part of multi @-@ lateral forces in iraq and afghanistan in total nearly <num> @,@ <num> australians died during the course of these conflicts <stop>
<start> for most of the last century military service has been one of the single greatest shared experiences of white australian males and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the 20th century it continues to influence australian society to this day war and military service have been defining influences in australian history while a major part of the national identity has been built on an <unk> conception of the australian experience of war and of <unk> known as the anzac spirit these ideals include notions of endurance courage ingenuity humour <unk> <unk> and <unk> traits which according to popular thought defined the behaviour of australian soldiers fighting at gallipoli during the first world war the gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw australians taking part as australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity <stop>
<start> the relationship between war and australian society has been shaped by two of the more enduring themes of australian strategic culture <unk> with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare indeed australian defence policy was closely linked to britain until the japanese crisis of <num> while since then an alliance with the united states has <unk> its security <unk> this pattern of <unk> — both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs as well as for more <unk> security concerns — has ensured that australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies regardless a tendency towards strategic <unk> has also been evident with australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to <unk> resources until a crisis arises a trait which has historically resulted in <unk> for major military challenges <stop>
<start> reflecting both the realist and liberal <unk> of international relations and the conception of national interests a number of other important themes in australian strategic culture are also obvious such themes include an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics the <unk> of notions of <unk> sovereignty a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a <unk> of security and the proposition that the status <unk> in international affairs should only be changed peacefully likewise <unk> collective security and defence self @-@ reliance have also been important themes change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic <unk> have persisted throughout its history being the product of australian society 's democratic political tradition and <unk> @-@ christian anglo @-@ european heritage as well its associated values beliefs and economic political and religious ideology these <unk> are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely european island on the edge of the asia @-@ pacific and the <unk> circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power to be sure during threats to the core australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result it has frequently become involved in foreign wars throughout these conflicts australian soldiers — known colloquially as <unk> — have often been noted somewhat <unk> for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities <stop>
<start> from <num> until <num> the defence of the australian colonies was mostly provided by british army regular forces originally marines protected the early settlements at sydney cove and norfolk island however they were relieved of these duties in <num> by a british army unit specifically recruited for colonial service known as the new south wales corps the new south wales corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of irish convicts at castle hill in <num> soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the war office of the need for a more reliable garrison in new south wales and van <unk> 's land chief of these shortcomings was the rum rebellion a coup mounted by its officers in <num> as a result in january <num> the 73rd <unk> regiment of foot arrived in australia by <num> <num> british infantry regiments had served in australia as had a small number of artillery and engineer units <stop>
<start> although the primary role of the british army was to protect the colonies against external attack no actual threat ever <unk> the british army was instead used in policing guarding convicts at penal institutions combating <unk> putting down convict rebellions — as occurred at bathurst in <num> — and to suppress aboriginal resistance to the extension of european settlement notably british soldiers were involved in the battle at the <unk> <unk> in <num> on the victorian <unk> members of british regiments stationed in australia also saw action in india afghanistan new zealand and the sudan <stop>
<start> during the early years of settlement the naval defence of australia was provided by detached royal navy units of the east indies station based in sydney however in <num> australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a <unk> marking the first occasion that royal navy ships had been permanently stationed in australia the royal navy remained the primary naval force in australian waters until <num> when the australia station ceased and responsibility handed over to the royal australian navy the royal navy 's depots dockyards and structures were given to the australian people <stop>
<start> the reactions of the native aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of british settlers in australia were varied but were inevitably hostile when the settler 's presence led to competition over resources and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants lands european diseases decimated aboriginal populations and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation by and large neither the british nor the <unk> approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare at times however the frontier wars did see the involvement of british soldiers and later mounted police units not all aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands while many <unk> served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes <stop>
<start> fighting between <unk> and europeans was localised as the <unk> did not form <unk> capable of sustained resistance as a result there was not a single war but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent <unk> or disorganised however a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with aboriginal resistance beginning in the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century this warfare <unk> the popular and at times academic myth of peaceful settlement in australia faced with aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres among the most famous is the battle of <unk> in western australia in <num> such incidents were not officially sanctioned however and after the <unk> creek massacre in new south wales in <num> seven europeans were hanged for their part in the killings however in tasmania the so @-@ called black war was fought between <num> and <num> and aimed at driving most of the island 's native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas although it began in failure for the british it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population <stop>
<start> it may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict as one sided and mainly <unk> by europeans on <unk> although many more <unk> died than british this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the europeans aboriginal tactics varied but were mainly based on pre @-@ existing hunting and fighting practices — using <unk> clubs and other primitive weapons unlike the indigenous peoples of new zealand and north america on the main <unk> failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the europeans although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms this was not widespread the <unk> were never a serious military threat to european settlers regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them on occasions large groups of <unk> attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued during which the <unk> would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage this could sometimes be effective with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their <unk> while the settlers <unk> however such open warfare usually proved more costly for the <unk> than the europeans <stop>
<start> central to the success of the europeans was the use of firearms however the advantages afforded by firearms have often been <unk> prior to the late 19th century firearms were often <unk> muzzle @-@ loading smooth @-@ bore single shot <unk> with flint @-@ lock mechanisms such weapons produced a low rate of fire while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within <num> metres <num> ft these deficiencies may have initially given the <unk> an advantage allowing them to move in close and engage with <unk> or clubs yet by <num> significant advances in firearms gave the europeans a distinct advantage with the six @-@ shot <unk> revolver the <unk> single shot breech @-@ loading rifle and later the <unk> @-@ henry rifle as well as rapid @-@ fire rifles such as the winchester rifle becoming available these weapons when used on open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of <unk> often proved successful the europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast @-@ moving often hidden enemies tactics employed included night @-@ time surprise attacks and positioning forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks <stop>
<start> the conflict lasted for over <num> years and followed the pattern of british settlement in australia beginning in new south wales with the arrival of the first europeans in may <num> it continued in sydney and its surrounds until the 1820s as the frontier moved west so did the conflict pushing into outback new south wales in the 1840s in tasmania fighting can be traced from <num> to the 1830s while in victoria and the southern parts of south australia the majority of the violence occurred during the 1830s and 1840s the south @-@ west of western australia experienced warfare from <num> to <num> the war in queensland began in the area around brisbane in the 1840s and continued until <num> moving to central queensland in the 1850s and 1860s and then to northern queensland from the 1860s to <num> in western australia the violence moved north with european settlement reaching the <unk> region by <num> with violent clashes continuing until the 1920s in the northern territory conflict lasted even later still especially in central australia continuing from the 1880s to the 1930s one estimate of casualties places european deaths at <num> @,@ <num> while at least <num> @,@ <num> <unk> are believed to have perished far more devastating though was the effect of disease which significantly reduced the aboriginal population by the beginning of the 20th century a fact which may also have limited their ability to resist <stop>
<start> in <num> the victorian ship <unk> victoria was dispatched to help the new zealand colonial government in its war against māori in <unk> victoria was subsequently used for patrol duties and logistic support although a number of personnel were involved in actions against māori fortifications one sailor died from an accidental gunshot wound during the deployment <stop>
<start> in late <num> the new zealand government requested troops to assist in the invasion of the <unk> province against the māori <unk> settlement on confiscated land more than <num> @,@ <num> australians over half of whom were from victoria were recruited to form four <unk> regiments other australians became scouts in the company of forest rangers despite experiencing <unk> conditions the australians were not heavily involved in battle and were primarily used for patrolling and garrison duties australians were involved in actions at <unk> <unk> east <unk> hill <unk> and te <unk> <unk> than <num> were believed to have been killed in action the conflict was over by <num> and the <unk> regiments disbanded in <num> however many of the soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities by the end of the decade while many others had returned to australia <stop>
<start> from <num> until <num> each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence the colonies had gained responsible government between <num> and <num> and while the colonial office in london retained control of some affairs the governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia to do this they were granted the authority from the british crown to raise military and naval forces initially these were militias in support of british regulars but when military support for the colonies ended in <num> the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities the colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia paid citizen soldiers and a small permanent component they were mainly infantry cavalry and mounted infantry and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline even after significant reforms in the 1870s — including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units — they remained too small and <unk> to be considered armies in the modern sense by <num> the forces numbered <num> @,@ <num> men although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the british empire during the 19th century with the colonies raising <unk> to serve in sudan south africa and china <stop>
<start> despite a reputation of colonial <unk> many of the locally raised units were highly organised disciplined professional and well trained during this period defences in australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery based on garrisoned coastal forts however by the 1890s improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led major general james edwards — who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces — to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid <unk> of brigades of infantry as a consequence he called for a <unk> of defences and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies edwards argued for the colonial forces to be <unk> and for professional units — obliged to serve anywhere in the south pacific — to replace the volunteer forces these views found support in the influential new south wales commandant major general edward hutton however suspicions held by the smaller colonies towards new south wales and victoria <unk> the proposal these reforms remaining unresolved however and defence issues were generally given little attention in the debate on the political federation of the colonies <stop>

<start> churchill was born in <unk> illinois to jack <unk> churchill and <unk> <unk> allen his parents divorced before he was two and he grew up in <unk> where he attended local schools <stop>
<start> in <num> he was drafted into the united states army on his <num> resume he said he served as a public @-@ information specialist who wrote and edited the battalion <unk> and wrote news releases <stop>

<start> in <num> the denver post reported that churchill 's military records show he was trained as a film <unk> and light truck driver but they do not reflect paratrooper school or <unk> training the 75th ranger regiment association found no record of churchill having been a member of the unit or a <unk> team <stop>
<start> churchill received his <unk> in technological communications in <num> and <unk> in communications theory in <num> both from <unk> state university now the university of illinois at springfield <stop>

<start> he has long been interested in issues associated with the <unk> act which broke up the communal reservation lands and assigned plots to individual households <unk> with that was the federal government 's first use of blood quantum to define individual membership in tribes for what became known as the <unk> rolls since re @-@ establishing self @-@ governments <unk> recognized tribes have established their own criteria for enrollment as members often related to descent from recognized historical lists but less often requiring proofs of blood quantum some of his published works address these issues which he has interpreted as part of the federal government 's policy of <unk> against native americans <stop>
<start> in <num> churchill discussed his views with david <unk> in an interview <stop>
<start> you could say that five hundred years ago was the basis of blood quantum in <unk> @-@ america but in anglo @-@ america while there was some preoccupation with it it was not formalized until the passage of the general <unk> act mid @-@ 1880s at that point they began to define indian as being someone who was <unk> and <unk> of at least one @-@ quarter by quantum blood indigenous in a given group you couldn 't be an eighth cheyenne and an eighth <unk> and be an indian you had to be a quarter cheyenne or a quarter <unk> or hopefully a quarter and a quarter the reason for this was quite clear they were identifying indians for purposes of <unk> them individual <unk> of land in the existing reservation base at that point if they ran out of indians identifiable as such then the rest of the land would be declared surplus so it was clearly in the interests of the government to create a definition of <unk> that would minimize the number of indians that were available it was an economic motivation for the application of this genetic criteria to <unk> in the first place it 's become increasingly so ever since david <unk> december <num> interview with ward churchill historical and current <unk> z magazine <stop>

<start> in a statement dated may <num> <num> and posted on its website the united <unk> band initially said <stop>
<start> the united <unk> band would like to make it clear that mr. churchill <unk> <unk> a member of the <unk> band and was only given an honorary associate membership in the early 1990s because he could not prove any <unk> ancestry the tribe said that all of churchill 's past present and future claims or <unk> of <unk> enrollment written or spoken including but not limited to biographies curriculum <unk> lectures applications for employment or any other reference not listed <unk> are deemed <unk> by the united <unk> band <stop>
<start> two days later the united <unk> band replaced its statement and acknowledged churchill 's alleged ancestry of being <unk> <stop>
<start> because mr. churchill had genealogical information regarding his alleged ancestry and his willingness to assist the <unk> in promoting the tribe and its causes he was awarded an associate <unk> as an honor the tribe 's website now said however mr. churchill may possess eligibility status for <unk> nation of oklahoma since he claims <num> <num> <unk> <stop>
<start> the tribe 's spokesperson lisa <unk> stated the tribe <unk> only members with certified one @-@ quarter american indian blood the website statement further clarified that churchill was not eligible for tribal membership due to the fact that he does not possess a certificate of <unk> of indian blood <unk> and the associate membership did not <unk> an individual to voting rights or enrollment in the tribe <stop>
<start> churchill has never asked for <unk> certification and finds the idea of being <unk> by the us government offensive <stop>
<start> in june <num> the united <unk> band had voted to stop <unk> associate <unk> such honorary associate membership recognizes an individual 's assistance to the tribe but it has nothing to do with indian ancestry and it does not <unk> an individual to vote in the tribe as a member the <unk> band states that churchill still holds the associate membership and it has not been rescinded in a separate interview <unk> berry formerly on the tribe 's enrollment committee and four years on its council said that churchill had never fulfilled a promise to help the tribe <stop>

<start> some of churchill 's native american critics such as vernon <unk> white earth ojibwe and <unk> <unk> <unk> southern cheyenne @-@ <unk> creek argue that his assertion of native american ancestry without the ability to prove it might constitute <unk> and grounds for termination the university has said that it does not hire on the basis of ethnicity the university of colorado 's research <unk> committee conducted a preliminary investigation into whether churchill misrepresented his ethnicity to add credibility and public acceptance to his scholarship the committee concluded that the allegation was not appropriate for further investigation under the definition of research <unk> <stop>

<start> though the film is presumed lost a synopsis survives in the moving picture world from september <num> <num> it states life in a country town is often tedious and <unk> and were it not for the little <unk> and <unk> the <unk> are constantly given existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed so the time honored get @-@ <unk> of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay the <unk> thought well of this established feature they made it a <unk> occasion for themselves as well as their guests they were hardly an overly wealthy family and their table was never notable for an <unk> of the good things of life but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time <stop>
<start> on the night before such an event neither <unk> <unk> or <unk> gale could get those minutes solid sleep for thought that they might have overlooked some essential in the guests comfort at the first <unk> of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the <unk> into shape so little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured when the prize dish was a splendid <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> were ever looking after the need of the said <unk> first <unk> gale would <unk> to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state and give it a stir then <unk> gale would <unk> over and give it a stir finally <unk> gale would have to come over and honor it likewise then arrived the guests the minister and the mrs. minister they were and some neighbors while she was receiving them the recollection came to <unk> gale that the beloved <unk> <unk> had not received its <unk> off she speeds to a <unk> of whiskey in the kitchen she <unk> into the <unk> the right proportion of liquor and goes back to her guests then <unk> gale remembers that the <unk> has not been flavored he too <unk> himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred <unk> no sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than <unk> gale who has just remembered about the forgotten <unk> rushes in and makes for the whiskey she <unk> the right proportion in too <stop>

<start> the the moving picture world reviewer found the subject to be too long but did not find it to be a fault the reviewer states a domestic comedy with a different flavor in fact with a <unk> <unk> for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of <unk> neither one knowing that the others have done likewise the humor in this piece centers around this <unk> what happened to the guests who <unk> of it certainly draws upon the imagination imagine eight people not to speak of the cat getting drunk on the brandy in one <unk> <unk> ... we do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week <unk> as well as <unk> were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters the <unk> <unk> episode was well done which is the faint praise that we do not like to <unk> out to anyone walton of the moving picture news was not <unk> by the plot and stated to me the last scene had no humor it was only the necessary ending to the beginning true humor does not <unk> from <unk> the new york dramatic mirror stated this is the old story of too many cooks and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way the early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation ... a weak point in the story is the fact that the <unk> is cut into eight small pieces making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power two <unk> would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing the character parts are all well taken although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera <stop>

<start> the title for the song was inspired by english singer @-@ songwriter marc <unk> some commentators have suggested that the lyrics were directed at paul mccartney reflecting starr 's disdain for the music mccartney had made as a solo artist over the previous two years back off <unk> demonstrates the influence of <unk> rock on starr who directed a documentary film born to boogie <num> about <unk> 's band t. rex around this time described by one author as a high @-@ energy in @-@ your @-@ face rocker the song features a prominent slide guitar part by harrison and contributions from musicians gary wright and klaus <unk> <stop>

<start> commentators have interpreted the song and particularly this statement as an attack by starr on his former beatles <unk> paul mccartney starr has denied any such interpretation instead claiming that the song was inspired by <unk> and nothing more beatles biographer robert rodriguez writes starr had publicly criticised mccartney 's solo albums mccartney <num> and ram <num> on release and author bruce <unk> <unk> the message of the middle eight as a plea for paul to produce better music the mention of sound ing wasted could also be a reference to mccartney 's <unk> with cannabis rodriguez suggests a further example of starr 's allegedly anti @-@ mccartney message exists in the song 's first verse <stop>

<start> where the streets have no name is a song by irish rock band u2 it is the opening track from their <num> album the joshua tree and was released as the album 's third single in august <num> the song 's hook is a repeating guitar <unk> using a delay effect played during the song 's introduction and again at the end lead vocalist bono wrote the lyrics in response to the notion that it is possible to identify a person 's religion and income based on the street on which they lived particularly in belfast during the band 's difficulties recording the song producer brian eno considered <unk> the song 's tapes to have them start from scratch <stop>
<start> where the streets have no name was praised by critics and became a commercial success peaking at number thirteen in the us number fourteen in canada number ten in the netherlands and number four in the united kingdom the song has remained a staple of their live act since the song debuted in <num> on the joshua tree tour the song was performed on a los angeles <unk> for the filming of its music video which won a grammy award for best performance music video <stop>
<start> the music for where the streets have no name originated from a demo that guitarist the edge composed the night before the group resumed the joshua tree sessions in an upstairs room at <unk> house — his newly purchased home — the edge used a four @-@ track tape machine to record an arrangement of keyboards bass guitar and a drum machine <unk> that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short on exceptional live songs the edge wanted to <unk> up the ultimate u2 live @-@ song so he imagined what he would like to hear at a future u2 show if he were a fan after finishing the rough mix he felt he had come up with the most amazing guitar part and song of his life with no one in the house to share the demo with the edge recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration <stop>
<start> although the band liked the demo it was difficult for them to record the song <unk> adam clayton said at the time it sounded like a foreign language whereas now we understand how it works the arrangement with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes was <unk> many times but the group struggled to get a performance they liked according to co @-@ producer daniel lanois that was the science project song i remember having this massive schoolhouse <unk> as we call them i was holding a pointer like a college professor walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking <unk> it was ridiculous co @-@ producer brian eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of where the streets have no name the band worked on a single take for weeks but as eno explained that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up through all of their work they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance <stop>
<start> so much time had been spent on <unk> work that eno thought it would be best to start from scratch his idea was to stage an accident and have the song 's tapes erased he said that this was not to force abandonment of the song but rather that it would be more effective to start again with a fresh performance at one point eno had the tapes <unk> up and ready to be recorded over but this <unk> never took place according to engineer flood fellow engineer pat mccarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing eno ready to erase the tapes dropped the <unk> of tea he was carrying and physically restrained eno <stop>
<start> the studio version of the song was compiled from several different takes it was one of several songs mixed by steve <unk> in the final months of recording the joshua tree drummer larry mullen jr. later said of the song it took so long to get that song right it was difficult for us to make any sense of it it only became a truly great song through playing live on the record musically it 's not half the song it is live <stop>
<start> where the streets have no name is played at a tempo of <num> beats per minute the introduction and <unk> are played in a <num> <num> time signature while the remainder of the song is in a common <num> <num> signature the songs opens with an instrumental section starting with <unk> @-@ like sustained <unk> notes the guitar fades in after <num> seconds this part consists of a repeated <unk> six @-@ note <unk> a dotted eighth delay effect is used to play each note in the <unk> twice thus creating a rich sound the bass and drums enter at <num> <num> <stop>
<start> the introduction following a i – iv – i – iv – vi – v – i chord progression creates a wall of sound as described by mark butler against which the vocals emerge after nearly two minutes the guitar part played for the remainder of the song features the edge strumming <unk> sixteenth notes the bass and drums continue in regular eighth and sixteenth notes respectively while bono 's vocal performance in contrast varies greatly in its <unk> he <unk> he <unk> he <unk> he <unk> <unk> he allows his voice to crack as well as timing by his usage of <unk> to slightly offset the notes he sings from the beat <stop>
<start> this development reaches a climax during the first chorus at the line burning down love a – g – f ♯ – d the melody progresses through a series of scale degrees that lead to the highest note in the song the <unk> at burning in later choruses bono sings blown by the wind with the same melody stretching the same note even longer after the third chorus the song 's <unk> is played the instrumentation reverting to the same state as it was in the introduction with a six @-@ note guitar <unk> played against sustained <unk> notes <stop>
<start> the lyrics were inspired by a story that bono heard about the streets of belfast northern ireland where a person 's religion and income are evident by the street they live on he contrasted this with the <unk> he felt when visiting ethiopia saying ... the guy in the song recognizes this contrast and thinks about a world where there aren 't such divisions a place where the streets have no name to me that 's the way a great rock n roll concert should be a place where everyone comes together ... maybe that 's the dream of all art to break down the barriers and the divisions between people and touch upon the things that matter the most to us all bono wrote the lyrics while on a humanitarian visit to ethiopia with his wife ali hewson he first wrote them down on an <unk> bag while staying in a village <stop>
<start> according to him the song is ostensibly about <unk> elevation whatever you want to call it bono who compared many of his lyrics prior to the joshua tree to sketches said that where the streets have no name is more like the u2 of old than any of the other songs on the lp because it 's a sketch — i was just trying to sketch a location maybe a spiritual location maybe a romantic location i was trying to sketch a feeling <stop>
<start> the open @-@ ended nature of the lyrics has led to many interpretations journalist michael campbell believed the lyrics send a message of hope and wish for a world that is not divided by class wealth race or any other arbitrary criterion with regard to the place bono was referring to in the song he said i 'm not sure really about that i used to think it was belfast ... journalist niall stokes believes the title was influenced by bono 's and his wife ali 's visit to ethiopia as volunteer aid @-@ workers bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open @-@ ended lyrics i can look at it now and recognize that the song has one of the most <unk> couplets in the history of pop music but it also contains some of the biggest ideas in a curious way that seems to work if you get any way heavy about these things you don 't communicate but if you 're flip or <unk> about it then you do that 's one of the <unk> i 've come to terms with <stop>
<start> originally the third single from the joshua tree was meant to be the song red hill <unk> town but where the streets have no name was released instead in august <num> the single was released on <num> @-@ inch <num> @-@ inch cassette and cd single formats three b @-@ sides were featured on the single including race against time silver and gold and <unk> thing except for the <num> @-@ inch release which only featured the latter two tracks the <num> @-@ inch single featured race against time on side a of the record despite being a b @-@ side and the cassette single featured all four tracks on both sides of the tape although not as successful as the album 's first two singles the song did chart well in the u.s. the song peaked at number <num> on the billboard hot <num> and number <num> on the album rock tracks charts the song reached number four on the uk singles chart and it topped the irish singles chart <stop>
<start> the video begins with an aerial shot of a block in los angeles and clips of radio broadcasts are heard with disc <unk> stating that u2 is planning on performing a concert downtown and expecting crowds of <num> @,@ <num> people police show up to the set and inform the band 's crew of the security issue that the film shoot is causing due to the large number of people who are coming to watch the performance two minutes into the video u2 are seen on the roof of a liquor store at the corner of 7th <unk> and s. main st. and perform where the streets have no name to a large crowd of people standing in the streets surrounding the building towards the end of the song the police tell the crew that the performance is about to be shut down and eventually police walk onto the roof while the crowd are <unk> the police <stop>
<start> the video for where the streets have no name was directed by <unk> avis and produced by michael <unk> and ben <unk> the band attracted over <num> @,@ <num> people during the video 's filming which took place on the <unk> of a liquor store in downtown los angeles on <num> march <num> the band 's performance on a <unk> in a public place was a reference to the beatles final concert as depicted in the film let it be <stop>
<start> during the shoot u2 played an eight @-@ song set which included four performances of where the streets have no name prior to filming a week was spent reinforcing the roof of the liquor store to ensure it would not collapse if it were to be <unk> by a group of fans a backup generator was put on the roof so the shooting could continue in the event that the authorities shut off the power on the primary generator which happened during filming <stop>
<start> the depiction of the police attempting to shut down the video shoot due to safety concerns actually happened during filming just as seen in the video <unk> was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police according to avis the events depicted in the video show what actually happened that day almost in real time and that getting <unk> was an integral part of the plan band manager paul mcguinness revealed in <num> that much of the confrontation with the police was exaggerated the group were hoping to get shut down by the authorities in order to <unk> the music video but the police continually gave them extensions for shooting the video in the background of the video is a sign for the million dollar hotel which was rebuilt to create some interest in case no one showed up at the film shoot although the video is of a live performance the audio used is from the studio @-@ recorded version of the song the video won the grammy award for best performance music video at the <num> grammy awards <stop>
<start> race against time was released on the <num> @-@ inch cassette and cd versions of the single the song developed from the band 's interest in urban funk and was described by the edge as a kind of afro @-@ rhythmic piece and a study in rhythm the bass riff in the song inspired by the <unk> was played by the edge but stemmed from some of clayton 's unused bass parts mullen 's drum part was recorded in a single take the song is primarily an instrumental piece but does contain some lyrics inspired by bono 's trip to ethiopia after live aid and his witnessing firsthand the famine in occurrence these lyrical references include bono singing in an ethiopian language and following it with the phrase race against time bono said of the song it reminds me of the desert the desert is so empty but it <unk> with a strange kind of <unk> john hutchinson of musician magazine described the song as having an african flavour and as being reminiscent of peter gabriel the track was used in the miami vice episode child 's play and is the only one of the single 's b @-@ sides that was never played live <stop>

<start> nme lauded the song as the opening track by saying the album starts by spitting furiously the publication praised bono 's impassioned singing and the edge 's guitar playing which transformed the instrument into something more than an <unk> abused piece of wood the review commented that the last ten seconds are <unk> beautiful the rocket wrote that the song builds a wall of sound that bono 's vocals cut through with a <unk> of <unk> as the lyrics <unk> the need for personal spirituality the reviewer compared the opening riff to <unk> <unk> <unk> reviewing the joshua tree stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic called the song an epic opener the service 's steve huey in a review of the song praised its <unk> propulsive rhythmic drive and <unk> chorus qualities he singled out for making it a fan favorite he called the song the perfect album @-@ opener <unk> the slow build of its arrangement toward a climactic peak huey also called bono 's delivery passionate and grandiose and his commitment to the material <unk> he believed the combination of his vocals and the band 's sonic power is what gave u2 its tremendous force <stop>

<start> on the joshua tree tour where the streets have no name was most often used to open concerts fans and critics responded favourably to the song in a live setting the san diego union @-@ tribune wrote that from the <unk> sonic opening strains of the song this audience was up <unk> and <unk> nme wrote that the song is one such occasion where the power afforded their songs is scary noting that during the song 's opening the arena <unk> in other reviews the song was called <unk> <unk> and powerful out of the <num> shows during the joshua tree tour streets was played at all except <num> of the concerts during the <unk> tour which took place in <num> and the beginning of <num> streets was only left out of the set list at one of the <num> concerts <stop>
<start> the song was performed at every show on the <num> – <num> zoo tv tour concerts from this tour were elaborate <unk> <unk> that bono performed as a variety of characters but for the end of the main set the group reverted to playing classics including where the streets have no name straight some of these performances of the song were accompanied by footage of the group in the desert from the joshua tree 's photo shoot the video was <unk> up for humorous effect — nme described the effect as giving it a silly charlie <unk> quality — and bono often acknowledged his younger self on the video screens this video would make a return during performances on the <num> and <num> legs of the u2 <num> ° tour some of the zoo tv performances of the song had a more electronic dance music arrangement that bore a resemblance to the pet shop boys synthpop cover of the song titled where the streets have no name i can 't take my eyes off you bono parodied this by occasionally adopting the deadpan vocal style used in the pet shop boys cover critics welcomed the song in the group 's setlist the independent said the song <unk> instant euphoria as u2 do what they 're best at slipping into epic rock mode playing music made for the arena in two other local newspaper reviews critics praised the song 's inclusion in a sequence of greatest hits <stop>

<start> the <unk> <unk> reaction often referred to as simply the <unk> <unk> is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of <unk> the reaction is typically divided into classical and modern variants depending on the reagents and substrates employed it was originally discovered by ivan <unk> <unk> <num> – <num> in <num> while studying the <unk> of <unk> vinyl <unk> <stop>
<start> as originally described the <unk> <unk> involves the activation of a <unk> <unk> using a stoichiometric lewis acid or <unk> acid promoter the key step of the reaction mechanism involves a <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> ring closure which forms the <unk> product see <unk> below as the reaction has been developed variants involving substrates other than <unk> <unk> and <unk> other than lewis acids have been subsumed under the name <unk> <unk> provided that they follow a similar <unk> pathway <stop>
<start> the success of the <unk> <unk> as a tool in organic synthesis stems from the utility and <unk> of <unk> as both motifs in natural products including <unk> the <unk> and a <unk> of <unk> and as useful synthetic <unk> for total synthesis the reaction has been used in several total syntheses and several reviews have been published <stop>
<start> the mechanism of the classical <unk> <unk> reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by <unk> to be an <unk> <unk> and is outlined below <unk> of the <unk> by the acid catalyst generates a <unk> cation which undergoes a <unk> allowed <unk> <unk> <unk> as dictated by the woodward @-@ hoffman rules this generates an <unk> cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a β @-@ hydrogen subsequent <unk> of the <unk> produces the <unk> product <stop>
<start> as noted above variants that deviate from this template are known what <unk> a <unk> <unk> in particular is the generation of the <unk> cation followed by <unk> ring closure to an <unk> cation in order to achieve this transformation the molecule must be in the s @-@ trans s @-@ trans conformation placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation the <unk> of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate with α @-@ substituted substrates having an increased population of the <unk> <unk> due to <unk> strain <unk> of an electron <unk> α @-@ <unk> by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation <stop>
<start> similarly β @-@ substitution directed inward <unk> the s @-@ trans conformation so severely that e @-@ z <unk> has been shown to occur in advance of <unk> on a wide range of substrates yielding the trans <unk> regardless of initial configuration in this way the <unk> <unk> is a rare example of a <unk> <unk> reaction whereas most <unk> are <unk> the example below uses <unk> hydride to trap the <unk> cation so that no elimination occurs see <unk> <unk> below <stop>
<start> along this same vein <unk> vinyl <unk> of the type studied extensively by marcus <unk> of the university of hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal of β @-@ <unk> <unk> a large amount of <unk> strain in the s @-@ <unk> <unk> <stop>
<start> though <unk> following the general template above had been observed prior to <unk> 's involvement it was his study of the <unk> of <unk> vinyl <unk> that marked the first major examination of this process <unk> correctly reasoned that the <unk> <unk> <unk> in situ to form a <unk> <unk> before ring closure to the <unk> product the reaction shown below involves an <unk> <unk> reaction to generate the <unk> <unk> <stop>
<start> research involving the reaction was relatively quiet in subsequent years until in the mid @-@ 1980s when several syntheses employing the <unk> <unk> were published <unk> below are key steps in the syntheses of <unk> and nor @-@ <unk> the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> that generates the <unk> <unk> <stop>
<start> the classical version of the <unk> <unk> suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to <unk> the first two are not evident from the mechanism alone but are indicative of the barriers to <unk> the last three stem from selectivity issues relating to elimination and <unk> of the intermediate <stop>
<start> strong lewis or <unk> acids are typically required for the reaction e.g. <unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> are not compatible with sensitive functional groups limiting the substrate scope <stop>
<start> despite the <unk> possibility for catalysis multiple equivalents of the promoter are often required in order to effect the reaction this limits the atom economy of the reaction <stop>
<start> the elimination step is not <unk> if multiple β @-@ <unk> are available for elimination various products are often observed as mixtures this is highly undesirable from an efficiency standpoint as <unk> separation is typically required <stop>
<start> <unk> destroys a potential <unk> decreasing the potential usefulness of the reaction <stop>
<start> <unk> of the <unk> is sometimes not <unk> meaning that products can be formed as mixtures of <unk> <stop>
<start> the shortcomings noted above limit the usefulness of the <unk> <unk> reaction in its canonical form however modifications to the reaction focused on <unk> its issues continue to be an active area of academic research in particular the research has focused on a few key areas rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter <unk> the reaction with more mild <unk> to improve functional group tolerance directing the <unk> of the elimination step and improving the overall <unk> these have been successful to varying degrees <stop>
<start> additionally modifications focused on altering the progress of the reaction either by generating the <unk> cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the <unk> cation intercepted in various ways furthermore enantioselective variants of various kinds have been developed the sheer volume of literature on the subject prevents a comprehensive examination of this field key examples are given below <stop>
<start> the earliest efforts to improve the selectivity of the <unk> <unk> took advantage of the β @-@ silicon effect in order to direct the <unk> of the elimination step this chemistry was developed most extensively by professor scott denmark of the university of illinois <unk> @-@ <unk> in the mid @-@ 1980s and utilizes stoichiometric amounts of iron <unk> to promote the reaction with <unk> products the <unk> <unk> was selected for to varying degrees <stop>
<start> the silicon @-@ directed <unk> <unk> reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product <unk> shown below the <unk> takes place before elimination of the <unk> alcohol <unk> so that the resulting <unk> of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the <unk> <unk> anti to the <unk> <stop>
<start> drawing on the <unk> effects compiled over various trials of the reaction professor alison frontier of the university of rochester developed a paradigm for polarized <unk> <unk> in which electron <unk> and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall selectivity of the reaction creation of an effective vinyl <unk> and vinyl <unk> in the substrate allows catalytic activation with copper <unk> and <unk> elimination in addition the electron withdrawing group increases the <unk> of the α @-@ proton allowing selective formation of the trans @-@ α @-@ <unk> via <unk> <stop>
<start> it is often possible to achieve catalytic activation using a <unk> or withdrawing group alone although the efficiency of the reaction yield reaction time etc is typically lower <stop>
<start> by extension any <unk> cation regardless of its origin is capable of undergoing a <unk> <unk> there have been a large number of examples published where the <unk> cation is arrived at by a variety of <unk> one such example involves the silver <unk> <unk> ring opening of <unk> <unk> <unk> the silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of <unk> silver chloride <stop>
<start> in the total synthesis of <unk> <unk> of a vinyl <unk> <unk> likewise generates a <unk> cation via ring opening of the resultant <unk> <stop>
<start> once the <unk> has occurred an <unk> cation is formed as discussed extensively above the typical course for this intermediate is elimination followed by <unk> <unk> however these two steps can be interrupted by various <unk> and <unk> respectively <unk> cation trapping has been developed extensively by <unk> g. west of the university of alberta and his review covers the field the <unk> cation can be trapped with <unk> and carbon <unk> and can also undergo <unk> <unk> with various <unk> partners <unk> below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a <unk> core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity <stop>
<start> <unk> trapping with various <unk> is <unk> less common in one study the <unk> <unk> is paired with a michael reaction using an <unk> catalyst to initiate nucleophilic <unk> addition of the <unk> to β @-@ <unk> in this tandem reaction the <unk> catalyst is required for both <unk> it acts as the lewis acid in the <unk> <unk> and in the next step the <unk> group of <unk> first coordinates to <unk> in a ligand exchange with the <unk> <unk> oxygen atom before the actual michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the r @-@ group <stop>
<start> the development of an enantioselective <unk> <unk> is a desirable addition to the repertoire of <unk> <unk> reactions to that end several variations have been developed utilizing <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are also known in which extant <unk> direct the <unk> almost all of the attempts are based on the idea of <unk> selecting one direction for the vinyl groups to <unk> in turn sets the <unk> as shown below <stop>
<start> <unk> @-@ directed <unk> <unk> can exhibit induced diastereoselectivity in this way in the example below the <unk> @-@ group acts to direct the <unk> by preventing the distant <unk> from rotating towards it via unfavorable <unk> interaction in this way the silicon acts as a <unk> auxiliary the starting material is not <unk> but the retention of enantiomeric excess suggests that the auxiliary directs the <unk> <stop>
<start> <unk> 's <unk> substrates can exhibit axial to <unk> <unk> transfer if <unk> <unk> are used the example below generates a <unk> <unk> in <num> yield and <num> enantiomeric excess <stop>
<start> <unk> has additionally developed a camphor @-@ based auxiliary for <unk> <unk> that was employed in the first asymmetric synthesis of <unk> the key step employs an unusual mixture of <unk> @-@ <num> @-@ <unk> and <unk> as solvent <stop>
<start> the first <unk> lewis acid promoted asymmetric <unk> <unk> was reported by <unk> aggarwal and utilized copper ii <unk> ligand complexes with up to <num> ee the enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use of <num> <unk> of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased <stop>
<start> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> are generally also subsumed under the same name for example an α @-@ β γ @-@ <unk> <unk> <unk> can undergo a similar <unk> <unk> <unk> that is typically referred to as an <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> reaction other such extensions have been given similar names including <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <stop>
<start> because they <unk> the <unk> cation β @-@ electron <unk> <unk> often severely impede <unk> <unk> building from this several <unk> ring openings of β @-@ <unk> <unk> have been reported these are typically referred to as retro @-@ <unk> <unk> reactions <stop>
<start> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> reaction known as <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> reactions have few instances there is one example of a <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> reported shown below and several <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> reactions in the literature even these tend to suffer from poor <unk> poor yields or narrow scope the difficulty stems from the relative over @-@ stabilization of the <unk> cation by electron donation <unk> <unk> <stop>

<start> du fu wade – giles tu fu chinese <unk> <unk> – <num> was a prominent chinese poet of the tang dynasty along with li <unk> li po he is frequently called the greatest of the chinese poets his greatest ambition was to serve his country as a successful civil servant but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations his life like the whole country was devastated by the an <unk> rebellion of <unk> and his last <num> years were a time of almost constant unrest <stop>
<start> although initially he was little @-@ known to other writers his works came to be hugely influential in both chinese and japanese literary culture of his poetic writing nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the ages he has been called the poet @-@ historian and the poet @-@ sage by chinese critics while the range of his work has allowed him to be introduced to western readers as the chinese virgil horace <unk> shakespeare milton burns <unk> <unk> hugo or <unk> <stop>
<start> traditional chinese literary criticism emphasized the life of the author when interpreting a work a practice which burton watson attributes to the close links that traditional chinese thought posits between art and morality since many of du fu 's poems feature morality and history this practice is particularly important another reason identified by the chinese historian william <unk> is that chinese poems are typically <unk> <unk> context that might be relevant but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know for modern western readers the less accurately we know the time the place and the circumstances in the background the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly and the result will be that we either <unk> the poem or fail to understand it altogether stephen owen suggests a third factor particular to du fu arguing that the variety of the poet 's work required consideration of his whole life rather than the <unk> <unk> used for more limited poets <stop>
<start> most of what is known of du fu 's life comes from his poems his paternal grandfather was du <unk> a noted politician and poet during the reign of empress wu du fu was born in <unk> the exact birthplace is unknown except that it was near luoyang henan province gong county is a favourite candidate in later life he considered himself to belong to the capital city of chang 'an ancestral hometown of the du family <stop>
<start> du fu 's mother died shortly after he was born and he was partially raised by his aunt he had an elder brother who died young he also had three half brothers and one half sister to whom he frequently refers in his poems although he never mentions his stepmother <stop>
<start> the son of a minor scholar @-@ official his youth was spent on the standard education of a future civil servant study and <unk> of the confucian classics of philosophy history and poetry he later claimed to have produced <unk> poems by his early teens but these have been lost <stop>
<start> in the early <unk> he travelled in the <unk> zhejiang area his earliest surviving poem describing a poetry contest is thought to date from the end of this period around <num> in that year he took the civil service exam likely in chang 'an he failed to his surprise and that of centuries of later critics <unk> concludes that he probably failed because his prose style at the time was too dense and obscure while chou suggests his failure to <unk> connections in the capital may have been to blame after this failure he went back to traveling this time around shandong and hebei <stop>
<start> his father died around <num> du fu would have been allowed to enter the civil service because of his father 's rank but he is thought to have given up the privilege in favour of one of his half brothers he spent the next four years living in the luoyang area fulfilling his duties in domestic affairs <stop>
<start> in the autumn of <unk> he met li <unk> li po for the first time and the two poets formed a friendship david young describes this as the most significant formative element in du fu 's artistic development because it gave him a living example of the reclusive poet @-@ scholar life to which he was attracted after his failure in the civil service exam the relationship was somewhat one @-@ sided however du fu was by some years the younger while li <unk> was already a poetic star we have twelve poems to or about li <unk> from the younger poet but only one in the other direction they met again only once in <unk> <stop>
<start> in <num> he moved to the capital in an attempt to resurrect his official career he took the civil service exam a second time during the following year but all the candidates were failed by the prime minister apparently in order to prevent the emergence of possible rivals he never again attempted the examinations instead <unk> the emperor directly in <unk> <num> and probably again in <unk> he married around <unk> and by <unk> the couple had had five children — three sons and two daughters — but one of the sons died in infancy in <unk> from <num> he began to have lung problems probably asthma the first of a series of <unk> which <unk> him for the rest of his life it was in that year that du fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoil of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region <stop>
<start> in <unk> he received an appointment as <unk> of the right commandant 's office of the crown prince 's palace although this was a minor post in normal times it would have been at least the start of an official career even before he had begun work however the position was swept away by events <stop>
<start> the an <unk> rebellion began in december <unk> and was not completely suppressed for almost eight years it caused enormous disruption to chinese society the census of <num> recorded <num> @.@ <num> million people but ten years later the census counted just <num> @.@ <num> million the remainder having been displaced or killed during this time du fu led a largely itinerant life <unk> by wars associated <unk> and imperial <unk> this period of <unk> was the making of du fu as a poet even shan chou has written that what he saw around him — the lives of his family neighbors and strangers – what he heard and what he hoped for or feared from the progress of various campaigns — these became the enduring themes of his poetry even when he learned of the death of his youngest child he turned to the suffering of others in his poetry instead of dwelling upon his own <unk> du fu wrote <stop>
<start> <unk> on what i have lived through if even i know such suffering the common man must surely be <unk> by the winds <stop>
<start> in <unk> emperor <unk> was forced to flee the capital and <unk> du fu who had been away from the city took his family to a place of safety and attempted to join the court of the new emperor <unk> but he was captured by the rebels and taken to chang 'an in the autumn his youngest son du <unk> baby bear was born around this time du fu is thought to have contracted malaria <stop>
<start> he escaped from chang 'an the following year and was appointed <unk> when he rejoined the court in may <unk> this post gave access to the emperor but was largely ceremonial du fu 's <unk> compelled him to try to make use of it he caused trouble for himself by protesting the removal of his friend and patron fang guan on a petty charge he was arrested but was <unk> in june he was granted leave to visit his family in september but he soon rejoined the court and on december <num> <unk> he returned to chang 'an with the emperor following its recapture by government forces however his advice continued to be <unk> and in the summer of <unk> he was demoted to a post as commissioner of education in <unk> the position was not to his taste in one poem he wrote <stop>
<start> i am about to scream <unk> in the office especially when they bring more papers to pile higher on my desk <stop>
<start> he moved on in the summer of <unk> this has traditionally been ascribed to famine but <unk> believes that frustration is a more likely reason he next spent around six weeks in <unk> now <unk> gansu province where he wrote more than sixty poems <stop>
<start> in december <unk> he briefly stayed in <unk> modern gansu he departed on december <num> for <unk> sichuan province where he was hosted by local <unk> and fellow poet <unk> di du subsequently based himself in sichuan for most of the next five years by the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble and sent poems <unk> help to various acquaintances he was relieved by yan wu a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at <unk> despite his financial problems this was one of the <unk> and most peaceful periods of his life many of du 's poems from this period are peaceful depictions of his life at <unk> <unk> in <num> he left the city to escape a rebellion but he returned in summer <unk> when he was appointed an advisor to yan who was involved in campaigns against the <unk> empire <stop>
<start> luoyang the region of his birthplace was recovered by government forces in the winter of <num> and in the spring of <unk> du fu and his family sailed down the yangtze apparently with the intention of making their way there they traveled slowly held up by his ill @-@ health by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight <unk> and general old age in addition to his previous <unk> they stayed in <unk> in what is now <unk> <unk> at the entrance to the three <unk> for almost two years from late spring <unk> this period was du fu 's last great poetic flowering and here he wrote <num> poems in his dense late style in autumn <unk> bo <unk> became governor of the region he supported du fu financially and employed him as his unofficial secretary <stop>
<start> in march <unk> he began his journey again and got as far as <unk> province where he died in <unk> now <unk> in november or december <num> in his <unk> year he was survived by his wife and two sons who remained in the area for some years at least his last known descendant is a grandson who requested a grave inscription for the poet from yuan <unk> in <unk> <stop>
<start> <unk> <unk> his life by concluding that he appeared to be a <unk> son an affectionate father a generous brother a faithful husband a loyal friend a <unk> official and a patriotic subject <stop>
<start> below is an example of one of du fu 's later works to my <unk> friend <unk> chinese <unk> like many other poems in the tang it featured the theme of a long parting between friends which was often due to officials being frequently transferred to the provinces <stop>
<start> criticism of du fu 's works has focused on his strong sense of history his moral engagement and his technical excellence <stop>
<start> since the song dynasty critics have called du fu the poet historian <unk> <unk> <unk> the most directly historical of his poems are those commenting on military tactics or the successes and failures of the government or the poems of advice which he wrote to the emperor <unk> he wrote about the effect of the times in which he lived on himself and on the ordinary people of china as watson notes this is information of a kind seldom found in the officially compiled histories of the era <stop>
<start> du fu 's political comments are based on emotion rather than calculation his <unk> have been <unk> as let us all be less selfish let us all do what we are supposed to do since his views were impossible to disagree with his <unk> expressed <unk> enabled his installation as the central figure of chinese poetic history <stop>
<start> a second favourite epithet of chinese critics is that of poet sage <unk> <unk> <unk> a counterpart to the philosophical sage <unk> one of the earliest surviving works the song of the <unk> from around <num> gives voice to the <unk> of a <unk> soldier in the imperial army and a clear @-@ sighted consciousness of suffering these concerns are continuously articulated in poems on the lives of both soldiers and civilians produced by du fu throughout his life <stop>
<start> although du fu 's frequent references to his own difficulties can give the impression of an all @-@ consuming <unk> hawkes argues that his famous compassion in fact includes himself viewed quite <unk> and almost as an <unk> he therefore lends grandeur to the wider picture by comparing it to his own slightly comical triviality <stop>
<start> du fu 's compassion for himself and for others was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment zhang jie wrote that for du fu everything in this world is poetry du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life calligraphy paintings animals and other poems <stop>
<start> du fu 's work is notable above all for its range chinese critics traditionally used the term <unk> <unk> complete <unk> a reference to <unk> description of <unk> yuan <unk> was the first to note the breadth of du fu 's achievement writing in <unk> that his predecessor united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly he mastered all the forms of chinese poetry chou says that in every form he either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples furthermore his poems use a wide range of registers from the direct and <unk> to the <unk> and self @-@ consciously literary this variety is <unk> even within individual works owen identifies the rapid stylistic and thematic shifts in poems which enable the poet to represent different <unk> of a situation while chou uses the term juxtaposition as the major analytical tool in her work du fu is noted for having written more on <unk> and painting than any other writer of his time he wrote eighteen poems on painting alone more than any other tang poet du fu 's seemingly negative commentary on the prized horse paintings of han <unk> <unk> a controversy that has persisted to the present day <stop>
<start> the tenor of his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his surroundings <unk> @-@ like according to watson his earliest works are in a relatively derivative courtly style but he came into his own in the years of the rebellion owen comments on the <unk> simplicity of the <unk> poems which mirrors the desert landscape the works from his <unk> period are light often finely observed while the poems from the late <unk> period have a density and power of vision <stop>
<start> although he wrote in all poetic forms du fu is best known for his <unk> a type of poem with strict constraints on form and content for example <stop>
<start> about two thirds of du fu 's <num> extant works are in this form and he is generally considered to be its leading exponent his best <unk> use the <unk> required by the form to add expressive content rather than as mere technical restrictions hawkes comments that it is amazing that tu fu is able to use so immensely stylized a form in so natural a manner <stop>
<start> according to the <unk> britannica du fu 's writings are considered by many literary critics to be among the greatest of all time and it states his dense compressed language makes use of all the <unk> overtones of a phrase and of all the <unk> <unk> of the individual word qualities that no translation can ever reveal <stop>
<start> in his lifetime and immediately following his death du fu was not greatly appreciated in part this can be attributed to his stylistic and formal innovations some of which are still considered extremely daring and bizarre by chinese critics there are few contemporary references to him — only eleven poems from six writers — and these describe him in terms of affection but not as a <unk> of poetic or moral ideals du fu is also poorly represented in contemporary anthologies of poetry <stop>
<start> however as <unk> notes he is the only chinese poet whose influence grew with time and his works began to increase in popularity in the ninth century early positive comments came from <unk> <unk> who praised the moral sentiments of some of du fu 's works although he found these in only a small fraction of the poems and from han yu who wrote a piece defending du fu and li <unk> on aesthetic grounds from attacks made against them both these writers showed the influence of du fu in their own poetic work by the beginning of the 10th century <unk> <unk> constructed the first replica of his <unk> cottage in sichuan <stop>
<start> it was in the 11th century during the northern song era that du fu 's reputation reached its peak in this period a comprehensive re @-@ evaluation of earlier poets took place in which wang <unk> li <unk> and du fu came to be regarded as representing respectively the buddhist <unk> and confucian strands of chinese culture at the same time the development of neo @-@ <unk> ensured that du fu as its poetic <unk> occupied the paramount position su shi famously expressed this reasoning when he wrote that du fu was <unk> ... because ... through all his <unk> he never for the space of a meal <unk> his sovereign his influence was helped by his ability to reconcile apparent opposites political <unk> were attracted by his loyalty to the established order while political radicals embraced his concern for the poor literary <unk> could look to his technical mastery while literary radicals were inspired by his innovations since the establishment of the people 's republic of china du fu 's loyalty to the state and concern for the poor have been interpreted as embryonic nationalism and socialism and he has been praised for his use of simple people 's language <stop>
<start> du fu 's popularity grew to such an extent that it is as hard to measure his influence as that of shakespeare in england it was hard for any chinese poet not to be influenced by him while there was never another du fu individual poets followed in the traditions of specific aspects of his work <unk> <unk> 's concern for the poor lu you 's patriotism and <unk> <unk> 's <unk> on the <unk> are a few examples more broadly du fu 's work in transforming the <unk> from mere word play into a vehicle for serious poetic <unk> set the stage for every subsequent writer in the genre <stop>
<start> in the 20th century he was the favourite poet of kenneth <unk> who has described him as the greatest non @-@ epic non @-@ dramatic poet who has survived in any language and commented that he has made me a better man as a moral agent and as a <unk> organism <stop>
<start> du fu 's poetry has made a profound impact on japanese literature especially on the literature from the <unk> period and on scholars and poets in the edo period including <unk> <unk> the very greatest of all <unk> poets even in modern japanese the term saint of poetry <unk> <unk> is mostly synonymous with du fu <stop>
<start> until the 13th century the japanese preferred <unk> <unk> above all poets and there were few references to du fu although his influence can be seen in some <unk> chinese poetry made by japanese poets anthologies such as <unk> <unk> in the 9th century the first notable japanese <unk> of du fu 's poetry was <unk> <unk> <unk> – <unk> a <unk> <unk> patriarch and one of the most prominent authors of the literature of the five mountains he highly praised du fu and made a commentary on some poems of du fu from the perspective of a <unk> priest in vol <num> of <unk> his student <unk> <unk> composed many <unk> which were clearly stated influenced by du fu in their <unk> <unk> 's student <unk> <unk> had close connection with the court and <unk> <unk> and <unk> du fu 's poetry in the mundane world one day <unk> <unk> the <unk> regent of the court and the highest authority of <unk> poetry asked <unk> should i learn the poetry of du fu and li <unk> <unk> <unk> to reply yes if you do have enough capability no if do not since then there had been many <unk> on du fu 's poetry both in <unk> temples and in the aristocratic society and as a result his poetry was often cited in japanese literature in the <unk> period e.g. <unk> a historical epic in the late 14th century and some <unk> plays such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <stop>
<start> during the kan <unk> era of the edo period <num> – <num> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the ming dynasty 's <unk> <unk> on du fu 's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was imported into japan and it gained explosive popularity in confucian scholars and <unk> <unk> class the commentary established du fu 's fame as the highest of all poets for instance <unk> <unk> a notable confucian scholar commented in vol <num> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> du fu was the very best poet in history and praised <unk> <unk> 's commentary for its simplicity and readability while he criticized old commentaries during the yuan dynasty were too <unk> <unk> <unk> the greatest <unk> poet was also strongly influenced by du fu in <unk> no <unk> his masterpiece he cites the first two lines of a spring view <unk> before a <unk> as its introduction and also many of his other <unk> have similar wording and themes it is said that when he died in osaka during a long travel a copy of du fu 's poetry was found with him as one of a few precious items which he was able to carry around <stop>
<start> a variety of styles have been used in efforts to translate du fu 's work into english as burton watson remarks in the selected poems of du fu there are many different ways to approach the problems involved in translating du fu which is why we need as many different translations as possible <unk> <unk> the translators have had to contend with bringing out the formal constraints of the original without sounding <unk> to a western ear particularly when translating regulated verse or <unk> and <unk> the complex allusions contained particularly in the later works hawkes writes that his poems do not as a rule come through very well in translation — <unk> <unk> one extreme on each issue is represented by kenneth <unk> 's one hundred poems from the chinese his are free translations which seek to conceal the <unk> through <unk> and expansion and contraction of the content his responses to the allusions are firstly to <unk> most of these poems from his selection and <unk> to translate out the references in those works which he does select <stop>
<start> other translators have placed much greater weight on trying to convey a sense of the poetic forms used by du fu vikram seth in three chinese poets uses english @-@ style rhyme schemes whereas keith <unk> in facing the moon <unk> the chinese rhyme scheme both use end @-@ stopped lines and preserve some degree of <unk> in the selected poems of du fu burton watson follows the <unk> quite strictly persuading the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa similarly he deals with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive <unk> <stop>
<start> in <num> stephen owen published translations with facing chinese texts of the complete poetry of du fu in six volumes with extensive scholarly apparatus which emphasized <unk> <stop>

<start> despite the expensive reconstructions both vessels were considered obsolete by the eve of the pacific war and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war following the loss of most of the <unk> 's large aircraft carriers during the battle of midway in mid @-@ <num> they were rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give them the ability to operate an air group of <unk> a lack of aircraft and qualified pilots however meant that they never actually operated their aircraft in combat while awaiting their air group the sister ships were sometimes used to ferry troops and material to japanese bases they participated in the battle of cape <unk> in late <num> where they <unk> the american carrier fleet supporting the invasion of <unk> away from the landing beaches afterwards both ships were transferred to southeast asia in early <num> they participated in operation <unk> where they transported petrol and other strategic materials to japan the sisters were then reduced to reserve until they were sunk during american airstrikes in july after the war they were scrapped in <num> – <num> <stop>
<start> the design of the <unk> @-@ class battleships was shaped both by the ongoing international naval arms race and a desire among japanese naval planners to maintain a fleet of capital ships powerful enough to defeat the united states navy in an encounter in japanese territorial waters the <unk> 's fleet of battleships had proven highly successful in <num> the last year of the russo @-@ japanese war which culminated in the destruction of the russian second and third pacific squadrons at the battle of <unk> <stop>
<start> in the aftermath the japanese empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals for imperial dominance in the pacific ocean britain and the united states <unk> <unk> a japanese navy admiral and military theorist speculated that conflict would inevitably arise between japan and at least one of its two main rivals to that end he called for the japanese navy to maintain a fleet with at least <num> as many capital ships as the us navy this ratio <unk> theorized would enable the imperial japanese navy to defeat the us navy in one major battle in japanese waters in any eventual conflict accordingly the <num> imperial defence policy called for the construction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <num> t each and eight modern armoured cruisers <num> @,@ <num> long tons <num> @,@ <unk> t each this was the genesis of the eight @-@ eight fleet program the development of a cohesive battle line of sixteen capital ships <stop>

<start> the progress of <unk> 's construction while the <unk> waited for the funding to be released and foreign developments caused the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> @-@ class design the distribution of the <unk> gun turrets was the most obvious flaw as they complicated the protection of the <unk> magazine and exposed more of the ship to the blast effects of the guns when they fired another issue was that japanese sailors had problems maintaining a high rate of fire with the <num> @.@ <num> @-@ kilogram <num> @.@ <num> lb shells used in the manually loaded <num> @-@ millimetre <num> in secondary guns used in the <unk> class and earlier designs to resolve this issue the <unk> designed a smaller <num> @-@ millimetre <num> @.@ <num> in gun that offset its lighter shell weight with a higher rate of fire it also decided that the barbette armour of the earlier ships was too thin and wanted a modest increase in speed to partially counter the higher speeds of the latest foreign ships like the british queen elizabeth @-@ class battleships and russian <unk> @-@ class battlecruisers for financial reasons more powerful engines could not be ordered so the new design was lengthened slightly and the boiler rooms enlarged to increase speed by <num> @.@ <num> knots <num> @.@ <num> km h <num> @.@ <num> mph to <num> knots <num> km h <num> mph to save weight the forecastle deck was shortened so that the lower <unk> gun turret was lower than in the <unk> class this reduced the crew 's accommodations despite a significant increase in the crew 's numbers and naval historian <unk> <unk> believed that these ships had the worst <unk> of any japanese capital ship the final design was designated a @-@ <num> by the <unk> and differed enough from the a @-@ <num> design of the <unk> class that it was considered a separate class <stop>

<start> the second battle of <unk> <unk> was an engagement between united nations un and north korean <unk> forces early in the korean war from september <num> to september <num> <num> along the <unk> river in south korea it was a part of the battle of pusan perimeter and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously the battle ended in a victory for the united nations after large numbers of united states us and republic of korea rok troops repelled a strong north korean attack <stop>
<start> after the first battle of <unk> <unk> the us army 's 2nd infantry division was moved to defend the <unk> river line the division which was <unk> in combat was struck with a strong attack by several divisions of the korean people 's army which crossed the river and struck all along the division 's line the force of the attack split the us 2nd infantry division in half and the north koreans were able to penetrate to <unk> promoting a fight there <stop>
<start> the urgency of the threat to pusan perimeter prompted the us marine corps 1st provisional marine brigade to be brought in to reinforce the us army troops in two weeks of heavy fighting the us forces were able to force the north koreans out of the <unk> <unk> region the north koreans were further repulsed after the un counterattack at <unk> which culminated in the virtual destruction of the north korean army <stop>
<start> from the outbreak of the korean war and the invasion of south korea by the north the north korean people 's army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the republic of korea army and the united nations forces dispatched to south korea to prevent it from collapsing the north korean strategy was to aggressively pursue un and rok forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively attacking from the front and initiating a double <unk> of both flanks of the unit which allowed the north koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force which would then be forced to retreat in <unk> often leaving behind much of its equipment from their initial june <num> offensive to fights in july and early august the north koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any un force and push it south however when the un forces under the eighth united states army established the pusan perimeter in august the un troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which north korean troops could not flank and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior un logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the un army <stop>
<start> when the north koreans approached the pusan perimeter on august <num> they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter throughout august the <unk> 6th division and later the <unk> 7th division engaged the us 25th infantry division at the battle of <unk> initially <unk> a un counteroffensive before <unk> with battles at <unk> @-@ <unk> and battle mountain these attacks stalled as un forces well equipped and with plenty of reserves repeatedly repelled north korean attacks north of <unk> the <unk> 4th division and the us 24th infantry division <unk> in the <unk> <unk> area in the first battle of <unk> <unk> the north korean division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of us reserve forces were brought in to repel it and on august <num> the <unk> 4th division was forced back across the river with <num> percent casualties in the <unk> region five north korean divisions were repulsed by three un divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the battle of <unk> particularly heavy fighting took place at the battle of the <unk> <unk> where the <unk> 13th division was almost completely destroyed in the attack on the east coast three more north korean divisions were repulsed by the south koreans at p 'ohang @-@ dong during the battle of p 'ohang @-@ dong all along the front the north korean troops were <unk> from these defeats the first time in the war their strategies were not working <stop>
<start> in planning its new offensive the north korean command decided any attempt to flank the un force was impossible thanks to the support of the un navy instead they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle <unk> by intelligence from the soviet union the north koreans were aware the un forces were building up along the pusan perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle a secondary objective was to surround <unk> and destroy the un and rok units in that city as part of this mission the north korean units would first cut the supply lines to <unk> <stop>
<start> on august <num> the north korean commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units the north koreans called for a simultaneous five @-@ <unk> attack against the un lines these attacks would overwhelm the un defenders and allow the north koreans to break through the lines in at least one place to force the un forces back five battle groupings were ordered the center attack called for the <unk> 9th division <unk> 4th division <unk> 2nd division and <unk> 10th division break through the us 2nd infantry division at the <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <stop>
<start> during the north koreans september <num> offensive the us 25th infantry division 's us 35th infantry regiment was heavily engaged in the battle of <unk> river north of <unk> on the 35th regiment 's right flank just north of the confluence of the <unk> river and the <unk> river was the us 9th infantry regiment us 2nd infantry division there in the southernmost part of the 2nd infantry division zone the 9th infantry regiment held a sector more than <num> @,@ <num> yards <num> @,@ <num> m long including the <unk> area of the <unk> where the first battle of <unk> <unk> had taken place earlier in august each us infantry company on the river line here had a front of <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> m to <num> @,@ <num> feet <num> @,@ <num> m and they held only key hills and observation points as the units were extremely spread out along the wide front <stop>
<start> during the last week of august us troops on these hills could see minor north korean activity across the river which they thought was north koreans organizing the high ground on the west side of the <unk> against a possible american attack there were occasional attacks on the 9th infantry 's forward positions but to the men in the front lines this appeared to be only a standard patrol action on august <num> the un forces were alerted to a pending attack when much of the korean civilian labor force fled the front lines intelligence officers reported an attack was coming <stop>
<start> on the west side of the <unk> north korean major general <unk> <unk> sam commanding the <unk> 9th division issued his operations order to the division on august <num> its mission in the forthcoming attack was to outflank and destroy the us troops at <unk> <unk> by capturing the <unk> and <unk> areas to cut off the us 2nd division 's route of supply and withdrawal between <unk> and pusan however the north koreans weren 't aware that the us 2nd infantry division had recently replaced the us 24th infantry division in positions along the <unk> river consequently they expected lighter resistance the 24th troops were exhausted from months of fighting but the 2nd division men were fresh and newly arrived in korea they had only recently been moved into the line the north koreans began crossing the <unk> river under cover of darkness at certain points <stop>
<start> on the southern @-@ most flank of the 9th infantry river line just above the junction of the <unk> river with the <unk> a company of the 1st battalion was dug in on a long finger ridge <unk> the <unk> that terminates in hill <num> at the <unk> ferry site the river road from <unk> @-@ ri running west along the <unk> passes the southern tip of this ridge and crosses to the west side of the river at the ferry a small village called <unk> lay at the base of hill <num> and <num> yards <num> m from the river a patrol of tanks and armored vehicles together with two infantry squads of a company 9th infantry held a roadblock near the ferry and close to <unk> on the evening of august <num> a company moved from its ridge positions overlooking <unk> and the river to new positions along the river below the ridge line <stop>

<start> later in the morning north korean barges crossed the <unk> below a company the company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the southern tip of the ridge overlooking <unk> to take these troops under fire when the squad reached the tip of the ridge they saw that a north korean force occupied houses at its base the company hit these houses with artillery the north koreans broke from the houses running for the river at this the light machine gun at the tip of the ridge took them under fire as did another across the <unk> to the south in the us 25th infantry division sector <unk> <unk> artillery fire decimated this group combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated <num> casualties on this north korean force in the afternoon us aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company only part of it was recovered the 1st battalion ordered a company to withdraw the company that night <stop>

<start> a company 2nd engineer combat battalion moved to the south side of the <unk> @-@ <unk> river road d company of the 2nd engineer battalion was on the north side of the road approximately <num> miles <num> @.@ <num> km west of <unk> an estimated <num> north korean troops engaged a company in a fire fight <unk> gun motor <unk> of the 82nd aaa battalion supported the engineers in this action which lasted several hours meanwhile with the approval of general bradley d company moved to the hill immediately south of and overlooking <unk> a platoon of infantry went into position behind it a company was now ordered to fall back to the southeast edge of <unk> on the left flank of d company there a company went into position along the road on its left was c company of the engineer battalion and beyond c company was the 2nd division reconnaissance company the hill occupied by d company was in reality the western tip of a large mountain mass that lay southeast of the town the road to <unk> came south out of <unk> bent around the western tip of this mountain and then ran eastward along its southern base in its position d company not only commanded the town but also its exit the road to <unk> <stop>
<start> north koreans had also approached <unk> from the south the us 2nd division reconnaissance company and tanks of the 72nd tank battalion opposed them in a sharp fight in this action sergeant first class charles w. turner of the reconnaissance company particularly distinguished himself he mounted a tank operated its exposed turret machine gun and directed tank fire which reportedly destroyed seven north korean machine guns turner and this tank came under heavy north korean fire which shot away the tank 's <unk> and <unk> and scored more than <num> hits on it turner although wounded remained on the tank until he was killed that night north korean soldiers crossed the low ground around <unk> and entered the town from the south <stop>
<start> at <num> <num> september <num> while the north koreans were attempting to destroy the engineer troops at the southern edge of <unk> and clear the road to <unk> walker spoke by telephone with major general doyle o. <unk> deputy chief of staff far east command in tokyo he described the situation around the perimeter and said the most serious threat was along the boundary between the us 2nd and us 25th infantry divisions he described the location of his reserve forces and his plans for using them he said he had started the 1st provisional marine brigade toward <unk> but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that general of the army douglas macarthur approved his use of them since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the far east command walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd division lines without using them <unk> replied that macarthur had the day before approved the use of the us marines if and when walker considered it necessary a few hours after this conversation walker at <num> <num> attached the 1st provisional marine brigade to the us 2nd division and ordered a co @-@ ordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the marines with the mission of destroying the north koreans east of the <unk> river in the 2nd division sector and of restoring the river line the marines were to be released from 2nd division control as soon as this mission was accomplished <stop>
<start> a decision was reached that the marines would attack west at <num> <num> on september <num> <unk> the <unk> @-@ <unk> river road the 9th infantry b company of the 72nd tank battalion and d battery of the <unk> aaa battalion would attack northwest above the marines and attempt to re @-@ establish contact with the us 23rd infantry the 2nd engineer combat battalion remnants of the 1st battalion 9th infantry and elements of the 72nd tank battalion would attack on the left flank or south of the marines to reestablish contact with the 25th division eighth army now ordered the us 24th infantry division headquarters and the us 19th infantry regiment to move to the susan @-@ <unk> area <num> miles <num> km south of <unk> and <num> miles <num> km east of the confluence of the <unk> river and the <unk> river there it was to prepare to enter the battle in either the 2nd or 25th division zone <stop>
<start> the american counteroffensive of september <num> – <num> west of <unk> according to prisoner statements resulted in one of the <unk> <unk> of the war for a north korean division even though remnants of the <unk> 9th division supported by the low strength <unk> 4th division still held <unk> @-@ <unk> ridge <unk> hill and the intervening ground back to the <unk> on september <num> the division 's offensive strength had been spent at the end of the american counterattack the <unk> 9th and 4th divisions were not able to resume the offensive <stop>
<start> the <unk> 2nd division made a new effort against the 23rd infantry 's perimeter in the <unk> hours of september <num> in an attempt to break through eastward this attack launched at <num> <num> and heavily supported with artillery penetrated f company it was apparent that unless f company 's position could be restored the entire regimental front would collapse when all its officers became casualties first lieutenant ralph r. robinson adjutant of the 2nd battalion assumed command of the company with north koreans rapidly infiltrating his company 's position and gaining its rear robinson in the darkness made his way through them <num> yards <num> m to a company 's position there he obtained that company 's reserve platoon and brought it back to f company he accomplished the dangerous and difficult task of <unk> it into the gap in f company 's lines in darkness and heavy rain <stop>
<start> the attack tapered off with the coming of daylight but that night it resumed the north koreans struck repeatedly at the defense line this time they continued the fighting into the daylight hours of <num> september the air force then concentrated strong air support over the regimental perimeter to aid the ground troops casualties came to the aid stations from the infantry companies in an almost steady stream during the morning all available men from headquarters company and special units were formed into squads and put into the fight at the most critical points at one time the regimental reserve was down to six men when the attack finally ceased shortly after <num> <num> the 23rd regiment had an estimated combat efficiency of only <num> percent <stop>
<start> this heavy night and day battle cost the <unk> 2nd division most of its remaining offensive strength the medical officer of the <unk> 17th regiment 2nd division captured a few days later said that the division evacuated about <num> men nightly to a hospital in <unk> @-@ <unk> and that in the first two weeks of september the 2nd division lost <num> @,@ <num> killed and <num> @,@ <num> wounded in the fighting west of <unk> even though its offensive strength was largely spent by september <num> the division continued to harass rear areas around <unk> with infiltrating groups as large as companies <unk> daily had to open the main supply road and clear the town <stop>
<start> north korean and us troops remained locked in combat along the <unk> river for several more days the north koreans offensive capability was largely destroyed and the us troops resolved to hold their lines barring further attack <stop>
<start> the un counterattack at <unk> collapsed the north korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes on september <num> the un discovered the north koreans had abandoned much of the pusan perimeter during the night and the un units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them most of the north korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into north korea the north koreans withdrew from the <unk> area first the night of september <num> – <num> after the forces there the remainder of the north korean armies withdrew rapidly to the north the us units rapidly pursued them north passing over the <unk> river positions which were no longer of strategic importance <stop>

<start> of all the north korean attacks along the pusan perimeter the second battle of <unk> <unk> is seen by historians as the most serious threat it was the battle in which the north koreans made the most substantial gains splitting the us 2nd infantry division in half and briefly capturing <unk> where they were very close to breaching through to the us forces supply lines and threatening other divisions rear areas however once again the fatal weakness of the north korean army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success — its communications and supply were not capable of <unk> a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack in the face of massive air armor and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points by september <num> the north korean attacks in the area had been repulsed <stop>

<start> an ironclad is a steam @-@ propelled warship protected by iron or steel armor plates used in the early part of the second half of the 19th century the ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells the first ironclad battleship gloire was launched by the french navy in november <num> the british admiralty had been considering armored warships since <num> and prepared a draft design for an armored <unk> in <num> in early <num> the royal navy started building two iron @-@ <unk> armored frigates and by <num> had made the decision to move to an all @-@ armored battle fleet after the first clashes of ironclads both with wooden ships and with one another took place in <num> during the american civil war it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the <unk> ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat this type of ship would come to be very successful in the american civil war <stop>
<start> <unk> were designed for several roles including as high seas battleships coastal defense ships and long @-@ range cruisers the rapid evolution of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden @-@ <unk> vessel that carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel @-@ built <unk> battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century this change was pushed forward by the development of heavier naval guns the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea more sophisticated steam engines and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible <stop>
<start> the quick pace of change meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were finished and that naval tactics were in a state of flux many ironclads were built to make use of the ram or the torpedo which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat there is no clear end to the ironclad period but towards the end of the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out of use new ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers <stop>
<start> the ironclad became technically feasible and tactically necessary because of developments in shipbuilding in the first half of the 19th century according to naval historian j. richard hill the ironclad had three chief characteristics a metal @-@ skinned hull steam propulsion and a main armament of guns capable of firing explosive shells it is only when all three characteristics are present that a fighting ship can properly be called an ironclad each of these developments was introduced separately in the decade before the first ironclads <stop>
<start> in the 18th and early 19th centuries fleets had relied on two types of major warship the ship of the line and the frigate the first major change to these types was the introduction of steam power for propulsion while <unk> steamer warships had been used from the 1830s onwards steam propulsion only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the screw propeller in the 1840s <stop>
<start> steam @-@ powered screw frigates were built in the mid @-@ 1840s and at the end of the decade the french navy introduced steam power to its line of battle the desire for change came from the ambition of napoleon iii to gain greater influence in europe which required a challenge to the british at sea the first purpose @-@ built steam battleship was the <num> @-@ gun napoléon in <num> napoléon was armed as a conventional ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line but her steam engines could give her a speed of <num> knots <num> km h regardless of the wind conditions a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement <stop>
<start> the introduction of the steam ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line led to a building competition between france and britain eight sister ships to napoléon were built in france over a period of ten years but the united kingdom soon managed to take the lead in production <unk> france built ten new wooden steam battleships and converted <num> from older ships of the line while the united kingdom built <num> and converted <num> <stop>
<start> the era of the wooden steam ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line was brief because of new more powerful naval guns in the 1820s and 1830s warships began to mount increasingly heavy guns replacing 18- and <num> @-@ pounder guns with <num> @-@ pounders on sailing ships @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line and introducing <num> @-@ pounders on <unk> then the first shell guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the french <unk> henri @-@ joseph <unk> and by the 1840s were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the french navy royal navy imperial russian navy and united states navy it is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls as demonstrated by the russian destruction of an ottoman squadron at the battle of <unk> spelled the end of the wooden @-@ <unk> warship the more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red @-@ hot shot which could <unk> in the hull of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power <stop>
<start> the use of iron instead of wood as the primary material of ships hulls began in the 1830s the first warship with an iron hull was the gunboat <unk> built by laird for the east india company in <num> there followed also from laird the first full @-@ blown warships with metal hulls the <num> steam frigates <unk> and <unk> for the mexican navy but a thin iron skin while not being susceptible to fire or lethal <unk> like wood was not the same thing as providing iron armor calculated to stop enemy gunfire <stop>
<start> following the demonstration of the power of explosive shells against wooden ships at the battle of <unk> and fearing that his own ships would be vulnerable to the <unk> guns of russian fortifications in the crimean war emperor napoleon iii ordered the development of light @-@ draft floating batteries equipped with heavy guns and protected by heavy armor experiments made during the first half of <num> proved highly satisfactory and on <num> july <num> the french communicated to the british government that a solution had been found to make gun @-@ proof vessels and that plans would be communicated after tests in september <num> the british admiralty agreed to build five armoured floating batteries on the french plans establishing the important thames and <unk> iron works within the docks <stop>
<start> the french floating batteries were deployed in <num> as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the crimean war the role of the battery was to assist <unk> mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications the french used three of their ironclad batteries <unk> <unk> and <unk> in <num> against the defenses at the battle of <unk> on the black sea where they were effective against russian shore defences they would later be used again during the italian war in the adriatic in <num> the british floating batteries <unk> and meteor arrived too late to participate to the action at <unk> the british planned to use theirs in the baltic sea against the well @-@ fortified naval base at <unk> <stop>
<start> the batteries have a claim to the title of the first ironclad warships but they were capable of only <num> knots <num> km h under their own power they operated under their own power at the battle of <unk> but had to be towed for long range transit they were also arguably marginal to the work of the navy the brief success of the floating ironclad batteries convinced france to begin work on armored warships for their <unk> <stop>
<start> by the end of the 1850s it was clear that france was unable to match british building of steam warships and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required the result was the first ocean @-@ going ironclad the gloire begun in <num> and launched in <num> <stop>
<start> gloire 's wooden hull was modelled on that of a steam ship of the line reduced to one deck <unk> in iron plates <num> @.@ <num> inches <num> mm thick she was propelled by a steam engine driving a single screw propeller for a speed of <num> knots <num> km h she was armed with thirty @-@ six <num> @.@ <num> @-@ inch <num> mm rifled guns france proceeded to construct <num> ironclad warships including two more sister ships to gloire and the only two @-@ <unk> broadside ironclads ever built <unk> and <unk> <stop>
<start> the royal navy had not been keen to sacrifice its advantage in steam ships of the line but was determined that the first british ironclad would <unk> the french ships in every respect particularly speed a fast ship would have the advantage of being able to choose a range of engagement which could make her <unk> to enemy fire the british specification was more a large powerful frigate than a ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line the requirement for speed meant a very long vessel which had to be built from iron the result was the construction of two warrior @-@ class ironclads hms warrior and hms black prince the ships had a successful design though there were necessarily compromises between sea @-@ keeping strategic range and armour protection their weapons were more effective than that of gloire and with the largest set of steam engines yet fitted to a ship they could steam at <num> @.@ <num> knots <num> @.@ <num> km h yet the gloire and her sisters had full iron @-@ armour protection along the waterline and the battery itself warrior and black prince but also the smaller defence and resistance were obliged to concentrate their armour in a central citadel or armoured box leaving many main deck guns and the fore and aft sections of the vessel unprotected the use of iron in the construction of warrior also came with some drawbacks iron hulls required more regular and intensive repairs than wooden hulls and iron was more susceptible to <unk> by marine life <stop>
<start> by <num> navies across europe had adopted ironclads britain and france each had sixteen either completed or under construction though the british vessels were larger austria italy russia and spain were also building ironclads however the first battles using the new ironclad ships involved neither britain nor france and involved ships markedly different from the broadside @-@ firing <unk> designs of gloire and warrior the use of ironclads by both sides in the american civil war and the clash of the italian and austrian fleets at the battle of <unk> had an important influence on the development of ironclad design <stop>
<start> the first use of ironclads in action came in the u.s. civil war the u.s. navy at the time the war broke out had no ironclads its most powerful ships being six steam @-@ powered <unk> frigates since the bulk of the navy remained loyal to the union the confederacy sought to gain advantage in the naval conflict by acquiring modern armored ships in may <num> the confederate congress voted that <num> million be appropriated for the purchase of ironclads from overseas and in july and august <num> the confederacy started work on construction and converting wooden ships <stop>
<start> on <num> october <num> the css <unk> became the first ironclad to enter combat when she fought union warships on the mississippi during the battle of the head of <unk> she had been converted from a commercial vessel in new orleans for river and coastal fighting in february <num> the larger css virginia joined the confederate navy having been rebuilt at norfolk <unk> on the hull of uss <unk> virginia originally was a conventional warship made of wood but she was converted into an iron @-@ covered casemate ironclad <unk> when she entered the confederate navy by this time the union had completed seven ironclad gunboats of the city class and was about to complete the uss <unk> an innovative design proposed by the swedish inventor john ericsson the union was also building a large armored frigate the uss new <unk> and the smaller uss <unk> <stop>
<start> the first battle between ironclads happened on <num> march <num> as the armored <unk> was deployed to protect the union 's wooden fleet from the ironclad ram virginia and other confederate warships in this engagement the second day of the battle of hampton roads the two ironclads repeatedly tried to ram one another while shells bounced off their armor the battle attracted attention worldwide making it clear that the wooden warship was now out of date with the ironclads destroying them easily <stop>
<start> the civil war saw more ironclads built by both sides and they played an increasing role in the naval war alongside the <unk> warships commerce raiders and blockade runners the union built a large fleet of fifty monitors modeled on their namesake the confederacy built ships designed as smaller versions of the virginia many of which saw action but their attempts to buy ironclads overseas were frustrated as european nations confiscated ships being built for the confederacy — especially in russia the only country to openly support the union through the war only css <unk> was completed and she arrived in american waters just in time for the end of the war <stop>

<start> the first fleet battle and the first ocean battle involving ironclad warships was the battle of <unk> in <num> <unk> between the austrian and italian navies the battle pitted combined fleets of wooden frigates and <unk> and ironclad warships on both sides in the largest naval battle between the battles of <unk> and <unk> <stop>
<start> the italian fleet consisted of <num> ironclads and a similar number of wooden warships escorting transports which carried troops intending to land on the adriatic island of <unk> among the italian ironclads were seven broadside ironclad frigates four smaller ironclads and the newly built <unk> — a double @-@ <unk> ram <unk> them the austrian navy had seven ironclad frigates <stop>
<start> the austrians believed their ships to have less effective guns than their enemy so decided to engage the italians at close range and ram them the austrian fleet formed into an <unk> formation with the ironclads in the first line charging at the italian ironclad squadron in the <unk> which followed both sides were frustrated by the lack of damage inflicted by guns and by the difficulty of <unk> — nonetheless the effective <unk> attack being made by the austrian flagship against the italian attracted great attention in following years <stop>
<start> the superior italian fleet lost its two ironclads re d 'italia and palestro while the austrian <unk> screw two @-@ <unk> sms kaiser remarkably survived close actions with four italian ironclads the battle ensured the popularity of the ram as a weapon in european ironclads for many years and the victory won by austria established it as the predominant naval power in the adriatic <stop>
<start> the battles of the american civil war and at <unk> were very influential on the designs and tactics of the ironclad fleets that followed in particular it taught a generation of naval officers the misleading lesson that <unk> was the best way to sink enemy ironclads <stop>
<start> the adoption of iron armor meant that the traditional naval armament of dozens of light cannon became useless since their shot would bounce off an armored hull to penetrate armor increasingly heavy guns were mounted on ships nevertheless the view that <unk> was the only way to sink an ironclad became widespread the increasing size and weight of guns also meant a movement away from the ships mounting many guns broadside in the manner of a ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line towards a handful of guns in turrets for all @-@ round fire <stop>
<start> from the 1860s to the 1880s many naval designers believed that the development of the ironclad meant that the ram was again the most important weapon in naval warfare with steam power freeing ships from the wind and armor making them <unk> to <unk> the ram seemed to offer the opportunity to strike a decisive blow <stop>
<start> the <unk> damage inflicted by the guns of <unk> and virginia at battle of hampton roads and the spectacular but lucky success of the austrian flagship sms erzherzog ferdinand max sinking the italian re d 'italia at <unk> gave strength to the <unk> craze from the early 1870s to early 1880s most british naval officers thought that guns were about to be replaced as the main naval armament by the ram those who noted the tiny number of ships that had actually been sunk by <unk> struggled to be heard <stop>
<start> the revival of <unk> had a significant effect on naval tactics since the 17th century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the line of battle where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns this tactic was totally unsuited to <unk> and the ram threw fleet tactics into <unk> the question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle and if it had been combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water <stop>
<start> the ram finally fell out of favour in the 1880s as the same effect could be achieved with a torpedo with less vulnerability to quick @-@ firing guns <stop>
<start> the armament of ironclads tended to become concentrated in a small number of powerful guns capable of penetrating the armor of enemy ships at range calibre and weight of guns increased markedly to achieve greater penetration throughout the ironclad era navies also <unk> with the <unk> of rifled versus smoothbore guns and breech @-@ loading versus muzzle @-@ loading <stop>

<start> <unk> @-@ loading guns seemed to offer important advantages a breech @-@ <unk> could be <unk> without moving the gun a lengthy process particularly if the gun then needed to be re @-@ aimed the warrior 's armstrong guns also had the virtue of being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore and because of their <unk> more accurate nonetheless the design was rejected because of problems which plagued breech @-@ <unk> for decades <stop>
<start> the weakness of the breech @-@ <unk> was the obvious problem of sealing the breech all guns are powered by the explosive conversion of gunpowder into gas this explosion <unk> the shot or shell out of the front of the gun but also <unk> great stresses on the gun @-@ barrel if the breech — which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun — is not entirely secure then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break this in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew the warrior 's armstrong guns suffered from both problems the shells were unable to penetrate the <num> @.@ <num> in <num> mm armor of gloire while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing similar problems were experienced with the breech @-@ loading guns which became standard in the french and german navies <stop>
<start> these problems influenced the british to equip ships with muzzle @-@ loading weapons of increasing power until the 1880s after a brief introduction of <num> @-@ pounder or <num> @.@ <num> @-@ inch <num> mm smoothbore somerset gun which weighed <num> @.@ <num> tons <num> @.@ <num> t the admiralty introduced <num> @-@ inch <num> mm rifled guns weighing <num> tons these were followed by a series of increasingly <unk> weapons — guns weighing <num> <num> <num> <num> and finally <num> tons with calibre increasing from <num> @-@ inch <num> mm to <num> @-@ inch <num> mm <stop>
<start> the decision to retain muzzle @-@ <unk> until the 1880s has been criticised by historians however at least until the late 1870s the british muzzle @-@ <unk> had superior performance in terms of both range and rate of fire than the french and prussian breech @-@ <unk> which suffered from the same problems as had the first armstrong guns <stop>
<start> from <num> onwards the balance between <unk> and muzzle @-@ loading changed captain de <unk> invented a method of reliably sealing a breech adopted by the french in <num> just as <unk> the growing size of naval guns made muzzle @-@ loading much more complicated with guns of such size there was no prospect of <unk> in the gun for re @-@ loading or even re @-@ loading by hand and complicated hydraulic systems were required for re @-@ loading the gun outside the turret without exposing the crew to enemy fire in <num> the <num> @-@ ton <num> @-@ inch <num> mm guns of hms <unk> fired only once every <num> minutes while bombarding alexandria during the <unk> <unk> the <num> @-@ ton <num> mm <num> @.@ <num> inch guns of <unk> <unk> could each fire a round every <num> minutes <stop>
<start> in the royal navy the switch to breech @-@ <unk> was finally made in <num> as well as the significant advantages in terms of performance opinion was <unk> by an explosion on board hms <unk> caused by a gun being double @-@ loaded a problem which could only happen with a muzzle @-@ loading gun <stop>
<start> the calibre and weight of guns could only increase so far the larger the gun the slower it would be to load the greater the stresses on the ship 's hull and the less the stability of the ship the size of the gun peaked in the 1880s with some of the heaviest <unk> of gun ever used at sea hms <unk> carried two <num> @.@ <num> @-@ inch <unk> mm breech @-@ loading guns each weighing <num> tons — no british battleship would ever carry guns as large the italian <num> mm <num> @.@ <num> inch guns would be larger than any gun fitted to a battleship until the <num> @.@ <num> @-@ inch <num> mm armament of the japanese yamato class of world war ii one consideration which became more acute was that even from the original armstrong models following the crimean war range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as floating weapons @-@ platform could <unk> the advantage of <unk> american ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least <unk> along the surface of the water <unk> effective combat ranges they had learned during the civil war were comparable to those in the age of <unk> — though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in only a few rounds smoke and the general chaos of battle only added to the problem as a result many naval engagements in the age of the <unk> were still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets and well below the maximum reach of their ships guns <stop>
<start> another method of increasing firepower was to vary the <unk> fired or the nature of the propellant early ironclads used black powder which expanded rapidly after combustion this meant cannons had relatively short barrels to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell the <unk> of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress one important step was to press the powder into <unk> allowing a slower more controlled explosion and a longer barrel a further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which <unk> more slowly again it also put less stress on the <unk> of the barrel allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to <unk> <unk> <stop>
<start> the development of <unk> powder based on <unk> or <unk> by the french inventor paul <unk> in <num> was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels the guns of the pre @-@ <unk> battleships of the 1890s tended to be smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s most often <num> in <num> mm but progressively grew in length of barrel making use of improved <unk> to gain greater muzzle velocity <stop>
<start> the nature of the projectiles also changed during the ironclad period initially the best armor @-@ piercing <unk> was a solid cast @-@ iron shot later shot of <unk> iron a harder iron alloy gave better armor @-@ piercing qualities eventually the armor @-@ piercing shell was developed <stop>
<start> the first british french and russian ironclads in a logical development of warship design from the long preceding era of wooden ships of the line carried their weapons in a single line along their sides and so were called broadside ironclads both gloire and hms warrior were examples of this type because their armor was so heavy they could only carry a single row of guns along the main deck on each side rather than a row on each deck <stop>
<start> a significant number of broadside ironclads were built in the 1860s principally in britain and france but in smaller numbers by other powers including italy austria russia and the united states the advantages of mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one <unk> at a time and the rigging did not impede the field of fire <stop>
<start> <unk> armament also had disadvantages which became more serious as ironclad technology developed <unk> guns to penetrate ever @-@ thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried furthermore the adoption of <unk> as an important tactic meant the need for ahead and all @-@ round fire these problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater all @-@ round fire which included central @-@ battery turret and barbette designs <stop>
<start> there were two main design <unk> to the broadside in one design the guns were placed in an armoured casemate amidships this arrangement was called the box @-@ battery or centre @-@ battery in the other the guns could be placed on a rotating platform to give them a broad field of fire when fully armored this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or <unk> a barbette <stop>
<start> the centre @-@ battery was the simpler and during the 1860s and 1870s the more popular method <unk> guns amidships meant the ship could be shorter and <unk> than a broadside type the first full @-@ scale centre @-@ battery ship was hms bellerophon of <num> the french laid down centre @-@ battery ironclads in <num> which were not completed until <num> centre @-@ battery ships often but not always had a <unk> <unk> enabling some of their guns to fire directly ahead <stop>
<start> the turret was first used in naval combat on the uss <unk> in <num> with a type of turret designed by the swedish engineer john ericsson a competing turret design was proposed by the british inventor <unk> <unk> with a prototype of this installed on hms <unk> in <num> for testing and evaluation purposes ericsson 's turret turned on a central spindle and <unk> 's turned on a ring of bearings <unk> offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s the fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean @-@ going ironclads the second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret guns and armour protection by deliberately designing a ship with very low <unk> the weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armour low <unk> however also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage — and therefore range of the vessel in many respects the <unk> low @-@ <unk> <unk> and the broadside <unk> hms warrior represented two opposite extremes in what an <unk> was all about the most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes or <unk> this circle was designed by captain <unk> <unk> <unk> hms captain a dangerously low <unk> turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in <num> her half @-@ sister hms monarch was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams the third royal navy ship to combine turrets and masts was hms <unk> of <num> which carried two turrets on either side of the centre @-@ line allowing both to fire fore aft and broadside <stop>
<start> a lighter alternative to the turret particularly popular with the french navy was the barbette these were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a <unk> the crew was sheltered from direct fire but vulnerable to <unk> fire for instance from shore emplacements the barbette was lighter than the turret needing less machinery and no roof armor — though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top @-@ weight of their ships the barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s and with the addition of an armored gun @-@ house transformed into the turrets of the pre @-@ <unk> battleships <stop>
<start> the ironclad age saw the development of explosive torpedoes as naval weapons which helped <unk> the design and tactics of ironclad fleets the first torpedoes were static mines used extensively in the american civil war that conflict also saw the development of the spar torpedo an explosive charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat for the first time a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one — and given the relative <unk> of <unk> against ironclads the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously the u.s. navy converted four of its monitors to become <unk> armored spar @-@ torpedo vessels while under construction in <num> – <num> but these vessels never saw action another proposal the towed or harvey torpedo involved an explosive on a line or <unk> either to deter a ship from <unk> or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less <unk> <stop>
<start> a more practical and influential weapon was the self @-@ propelled or whitehead torpedo <unk> in <num> and deployed in the 1870s the whitehead torpedo formed part of the armament of ironclads of the 1880s like hms <unk> and the italian <unk> <unk> and enrico <unk> the ironclad 's vulnerability to the torpedo was a key part of the critique of armored warships made by the <unk> <unk> school of naval thought it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent destruction by gunfire would be slow enough to be easily caught by torpedo in practice however the <unk> <unk> was only briefly influential and the torpedo formed part of the confusing mixture of weapons possessed by ironclads <stop>
<start> the first ironclads were built on wooden or iron hulls and protected by wrought iron armor backed by thick wooden <unk> <unk> were still being built with wooden hulls into the 1870s <stop>
<start> using iron construction for warships offered advantages for the engineering of the hull however <unk> iron had many military disadvantages and offered technical problems which kept wooden hulls in use for many years particularly for long @-@ range cruising warships <stop>
<start> iron ships had first been proposed for military use in the 1820s in the 1830s and 1840s france britain and the united states had all experimented with iron @-@ <unk> but <unk> gunboats and frigates however the iron @-@ <unk> frigate was abandoned by the end of the 1840s because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot iron was more brittle than wood and iron frames more likely to fall out of shape than wood <stop>
<start> the <unk> of <unk> iron for warship hulls meant that iron was only adopted as a building material for battleships when protected by armor however iron gave the naval architect many advantages iron allowed larger ships and more flexible design for instance the use of <unk> bulkheads on the lower decks warrior built of iron was longer and faster than the wooden @-@ <unk> gloire iron could be produced to order and used immediately in contrast to the need to give wood a long period of <unk> and given the large quantities of wood required to build a steam warship and the falling cost of iron iron hulls were increasingly cost @-@ effective the main reason for the french use of wooden hulls for the ironclad fleet built in the 1860s was that the french iron industry could not supply enough and the main reason why britain built its handful of wooden @-@ <unk> ironclads was to make best use of hulls already started and wood already bought <stop>
<start> wooden hulls continued to be used for long @-@ range and smaller ironclads because iron nevertheless had a significant disadvantage iron hulls suffered quick <unk> by marine life slowing the ships down — <unk> for a european <unk> close to dry docks but a difficulty for long @-@ range ships the only solution was to sheath the iron hull first in wood and then in copper a laborious and expensive process which made wooden construction remain attractive iron and wood were to some extent interchangeable the japanese <unk> and <unk> ordered in <num> were sister @-@ ships but one was built of iron and the other of composite construction <stop>
<start> after <num> steel started to be introduced as a material for construction compared to iron steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight the french navy led the way with the use of steel in its fleet starting with the <unk> laid down in <num> and launched in <num> <unk> nonetheless had wrought iron armor plate and part of her exterior hull was iron rather than steel <stop>
<start> even though britain led the world in steel production the royal navy was slow to adopt steel warships the <unk> process for steel manufacture produced too many imperfections for large @-@ scale use on ships french manufacturers used the <unk> @-@ martin process to produce adequate steel but british technology <unk> behind the first all @-@ steel warships built by the royal navy were the dispatch vessels <unk> and mercury laid down in <num> and <num> <stop>
<start> iron @-@ built ships used wood as part of their protection scheme hms warrior was protected by <num> @.@ <num> in <num> mm of wrought iron backed by <num> in <num> mm of <unk> the strongest shipbuilding wood the wood played two roles preventing <unk> and also preventing the shock of a hit damaging the structure of the ship later wood and iron were combined in sandwich armor for instance in hms <unk> <stop>
<start> steel was also an obvious material for armor it was tested in the 1860s but the steel of the time was too brittle and <unk> when struck by shells steel became practical to use when a way was found to fuse steel onto wrought iron plates giving a form of compound armor this compound armor was used by the british in ships built from the late 1870s first for turret armor starting with hms <unk> and then for all armor starting with hms <unk> of <num> the french and german navies adopted the innovation almost immediately with licenses being given for the use of the wilson system of producing fused armor <stop>
<start> the first ironclads to have all @-@ steel armor were the italian <unk> <unk> and enrico <unk> though the ships were laid down in <num> their armor was not purchased from france until <num> the french navy decided in <num> to adopt compound armor for its fleet but found it limited in supply so from <num> the french navy was using steel armor britain stuck to compound armor until <num> <stop>
<start> the ultimate ironclad armor was case hardened nickel @-@ steel in <num> the u.s. navy tested steel armor hardened by the harvey process and found it superior to compound armor for several years harvey steel was the state of the art produced in the u.s. france germany britain austria and italy in <num> the german firm <unk> developed gas <unk> which further hardened steel armor the german kaiser friedrich iii laid down in <num> was the first ship to benefit from the new <unk> armor and the new armor was quickly adopted the royal navy using it from hms canopus laid down in <num> by <num> almost all new battleships used <unk> armor though the u.s. continued to use harvey armor alongside until the end of the decade <stop>
<start> the equivalent strengths of the different armor plates was as follows <num> in <num> mm of wrought iron was equivalent to <num> in <num> mm of either plain steel or compound iron and steel armor and to <num> @.@ <num> in <num> mm of harvey armor or <num> @.@ <num> in <num> mm of <unk> armor <stop>
<start> <unk> construction also <unk> the later debate in battleship design between <unk> and all @-@ or @-@ nothing armour design warrior was only semi @-@ armoured and could have been disabled by hits on the bow and stern as the thickness of armor grew to protect ships from the increasingly heavy guns the area of the ship which could be fully protected diminished <unk> 's armor protection was largely limited to the central citadel amidships protecting boilers and engines turrets and magazines and little else an ingenious arrangement of <unk> @-@ filled compartments and <unk> bulkheads was intended to keep her stable and afloat in the event of heavy damage to her un @-@ armored sections <stop>
<start> the first ocean @-@ going ironclads carried masts and sails like their wooden predecessors and these features were only gradually abandoned early steam engines were inefficient the wooden steam fleet of the royal navy could only carry <num> to <num> days coal and the situation was similar with the early ironclads warrior also illustrates two design features which aided hybrid propulsion she had retractable screws to reduce drag while under sail though in practice the steam engine was run at a low <unk> and a <unk> funnel which could be folded down to the deck level <stop>
<start> ships designed for coastal warfare like the floating batteries of the <unk> or uss <unk> and her sisters <unk> with masts from the beginning the british hms <unk> started in <num> was the first large ocean @-@ going ironclad to <unk> with masts her principal role was for combat in the english channel and other european waters and while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the atlantic she would have had little endurance on the other side of the ocean the <unk> and the similar ships commissioned by the british and russian navies in the 1870s were the exception rather than the rule most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts and only the italian navy which during that decade was focused on short @-@ range operations in the adriatic built consistently <unk> ironclads <stop>
<start> during the 1860s steam engines improved with the adoption of double @-@ expansion steam engines which used <num> – <num> less coal than earlier models the royal navy decided to switch to the double @-@ expansion engine in <num> and by <num> they were widespread however this development alone was not enough to herald the end of the mast whether this was due to a conservative desire to retain sails or was a rational response to the operational and strategic situation is a matter of debate a steam @-@ only fleet would require a network of coaling stations worldwide which would need to be fortified at great expense to stop them falling into enemy hands just as significantly because of <unk> problems with the technology of the boilers which provided steam for the engines the performance of double @-@ expansion engines was rarely as good in practice as it was in theory <stop>
<start> during the 1870s the distinction grew between first @-@ class ironclads or battleships on the one hand and cruising ironclads designed for long @-@ range work on the other the demands on first @-@ class ironclads for very heavy armor and armament meant increasing displacement which reduced speed under sail and the fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly <unk> hms <unk> launched in <num> but not commissioned until <num> was the last british battleship to carry masts and these were widely seen as a mistake the start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing rig on ironclad battleships <stop>
<start> <unk> persisted on cruising ironclads for much longer during the 1860s the french navy had produced the alma and la <unk> classes as small long @-@ range ironclads as overseas cruisers and the british had responded with ships like hms <unk> of <num> the russian ship general @-@ admiral laid down in <num> and completed in <num> was a model of a fast long @-@ range ironclad which was likely to be able to <unk> and <unk> ships like <unk> even the later hms shannon often described as the first british armored cruiser would have been too slow to <unk> general @-@ admiral while shannon was the last british ship with a retractable <unk> later armored cruisers of the 1870s retained sailing rig <unk> speed under steam in consequence it took until <num> for the royal navy to lay down a long @-@ range armored warship capable of catching enemy commerce raiders hms warspite which was completed in <num> while sailing rigs were obsolescent for all purposes by the end of the 1880s rigged ships were in service until the early years of the 20th century <stop>
<start> the final evolution of ironclad propulsion was the adoption of the triple @-@ expansion steam engine a further refinement which was first adopted in hms sans pareil laid down in <num> and commissioned in <num> many ships also used a forced draught to get additional power from their engines and this system was widely used until the introduction of the steam turbine in the mid @-@ 1900s decade <stop>
<start> while ironclads spread rapidly in navies worldwide there were few pitched naval battles involving ironclads most european nations settled differences on land and the royal navy struggled to maintain a deterrent parity with at least france while providing suitable protection to britain 's commerce and colonial outposts worldwide <unk> remained for the british royal navy a matter of defending the british isles first and projecting power abroad second those naval engagements of the latter half of the 19th @-@ century which involved ironclads normally involved colonial actions or clashes between second @-@ rate naval powers but these encounters were often enough to convince british policy @-@ makers of the increasing <unk> of strictly naval foreign intervention from hampton roads in the american civil war to the <unk> combined defences of naval <unk> such as <unk> and cherbourg <stop>

<start> the united kingdom possessed the largest navy in the world for the whole of the ironclad period the royal navy was the second to adopt ironclad warships and it applied them worldwide in their whole range of roles in the age of sail the british strategy for war depended on the royal navy mounting a blockade of the ports of the enemy because of the limited endurance of <unk> this was no longer possible so the british at times considered the risk @-@ laden plan of engaging an enemy fleet in harbor as soon as war broke out to this end the royal navy developed a series of coast @-@ defence battleships starting with the <unk> class these <unk> monitors were markedly different from the other high @-@ seas ironclads of the period and were an important precursor of the modern battleship as long @-@ range monitors they could reach bermuda <unk> for example however they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and obstructions and enemy monitors as the original monitors of the union navy proved to be during the civil war the british prepared for an overwhelming mortar bombardment of <unk> by the close of the crimean war but never considered running the smoke @-@ ridden shallow @-@ water gauntlet straight to st. petersburg with ironclads likewise monitors proved <unk> unable to overwhelm enemy fortifications single @-@ handed during the american conflict though their low @-@ profile and heavy armour protection made them ideal for running <unk> <unk> and obstructions however negated these advantages — a problem the british admiralty frequently acknowledged but never countered throughout the period the british never laid down enough <unk> @-@ class battleships to instantly overwhelm cherbourg <unk> or even new york city with gunfire although throughout the 1860s and 1870s the royal navy was still in many respects superior to its potential rivals by the early 1880s widespread concern about the threat from france and germany culminated in the naval defence act which promulgated the idea of a two @-@ power standard that britain should possess as many ships as the next two navies combined this standard provoked aggressive shipbuilding in the 1880s and 1890s <stop>
<start> british ships did not participate in any major wars in the ironclad period the royal navy 's ironclads only saw action as part of colonial battles or one @-@ sided engagements like the bombardment of alexandria in <num> <unk> british interests against ahmed <unk> 's egyptian revolt a british fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port of alexandria a mixture of centre @-@ battery and turret ships bombarded egyptian positions for most of a day forcing the egyptians to retreat return fire from egyptian guns was heavy at first but inflicted little damage killing only five british sailors few egyptian guns were actually dismounted on the other hand and the fortifications themselves were typically left intact had the egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars that were at their disposal they might have quickly turned the tide for the attacking british ironclads found it easy for accuracy 's sake to simply anchor whilst firing — perfect targets for high @-@ angle fire upon their thinly armoured <unk> <stop>

<start> little <unk> is the fourth and final poem of t. s. eliot 's four <unk> a series of poems that discuss time perspective humanity and salvation it was first published in september <num> after being delayed for over a year because of the air @-@ raids on great britain during world war ii and eliot 's declining health the title refers to a small anglican community in <unk> established by nicholas <unk> in the 17th century and scattered during the english civil war <stop>
<start> the poem uses the combined image of fire and <unk> fire to emphasise the need for purification and <unk> according to the poet humanity 's flawed understanding of life and turning away from god leads to a cycle of warfare but this can be overcome by <unk> the lessons of the past within the poem the narrator meets a ghost that is a combination of various poets and literary figures little <unk> focuses on the unity of past present and future and claims that understanding this unity is necessary for salvation <stop>
<start> following the completion of the third four <unk> poem the dry <unk> eliot 's health declined and he stayed in <unk> green surrey while he recovered during this time eliot started writing little <unk> the first draft was completed in july <num> but he was dissatisfied with it he believed the problems with the poem lay with his own inability to write and that precipitated by air raids on london he had started the poem with too little preparation and had written it too quickly after the first draft was written he set the poem aside and he left in september to lecture throughout great britain <stop>
<start> after months of not working on the poem eliot began to feel compelled to finish it it was not until august <num> however that he started working on it again in total there were five drafts the poem was finished by <num> september <num> and published in the october new english weekly little <unk> was intended to conclude the four <unk> series <unk> eliot 's views expressed in this series of poems <stop>
<start> little <unk> was the home of an anglican community established in <unk> by nicholas <unk> the <unk> household lived a christian life according to high church principles and the book of common prayer the religious community was dispersed during the english civil war between <unk> and <unk> but reformed ending with the death of john <unk> in <unk> eliot had visited the site in may <num> <stop>
<start> unlike the other locations mentioned in the titles of the four <unk> poems eliot had no direct connection to the original christian community as such the community is supposed to represent almost any religious community <stop>
<start> critics classify little <unk> as a poem of fire with an emphasis on <unk> and the <unk> fire the beginning of the poem discusses time and winter with attention paid to the arrival of summer the images of snow which provoke desires for a spiritual life transition into an analysis of the four classical elements of fire earth air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four following this is a discussion on death and destruction things <unk> and regret for past events <stop>
<start> while using dante 's <unk> <unk> style the poem continues by describing the battle of britain the image of warfare <unk> with the depiction of <unk> and the holy spirit is juxtaposed with the air @-@ raids on london in the second section a ghost representing the poets of the past stuck between worlds begins talking to the narrator of the poem the ghost discusses change art in general and how humankind is flawed the only way to overcome the problematic condition of humanity according to the ghost is to experience <unk> through fire the fire is described in a manner similar to julian of norwich 's writing about god 's love and discussed in relationship to the shirt of <unk> a shirt that burns its wearer little <unk> continues by describing the <unk> of the present and how history exists in a pattern the poem concludes by explaining how sacrifice is needed to allow an individual to die into life and be reborn and that salvation should be the goal of humankind <stop>
<start> in terms of renewal eliot believed that suffering was needed for all of society before new life could begin the original little <unk> community was built for living on monastic lines but the community was damaged and dispersed by puritan forces during the english civil war in <num> the church the centre of the community was restored in <num> and again in <num> the image of religious renewal is combined with the image of the london air @-@ raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world this compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the holy spirit <unk> communion with the dead and the repetition of history the theme is also internal to eliot 's own poems the image of the rose garden at the end little <unk> is the image that begins <unk> norton and the journey is made circular also the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within the family <unk> <stop>
<start> like the other poems making up the four <unk> little <unk> deals with the past present and future and humanity 's place within them as each generation is seemingly united in the second section there is a ghost who is the compilation of various poets including dante swift yeats and others when the ghost joins the poet the narrator states knowing myself yet being someone other this suggests that the different times merge at the same time that the different personalities begin to merge allowing a communication and connection with the dead later in the fourth section humanity is given a choice between the holy spirit or the bombing of london redemption or destruction god 's love allows humankind to be <unk> and escape the living hell through <unk> by fire the end of the poem describes how eliot has attempted to help the world as a poet he parallels his work in language with working on the soul or working on society <stop>
<start> the ghost a combination of many literary figures was originally addressed in the poem as <unk> <unk> before being revised as an ambiguous you <unk> <unk> was dante 's way of addressing <unk> <unk> a former mentor whom he meets in hell to which he has been condemned for <unk> eliot in a letter to john <unk> dated <num> august <num> explained why he changed the wording <stop>
<start> i think you will recognise that it was necessary to get rid of <unk> for two reasons the first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with yeats though i do not mean anything so precise as that however i do not wish to take the responsibility of putting yeats or anybody else into hell and i do not want to <unk> to him the particular vice which took <unk> there <unk> although the reference to that <unk> is intended to be explicit i wish the effect of the whole to be <unk> which is more appropriate that brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of <unk> <num> where the poets are found <stop>
<start> the theme of swimming through flames is connected to the depiction of <unk> <unk> a poet that influenced dante seeking such a state in <unk> <unk> however the depiction of swimming was transformed into an image of dancing an act that appears throughout yeats 's poetry within <unk> flames the critic dominic <unk> suggests that in combining the image of dancing with <unk> eliot <unk> dante 's and yeats 's poetic themes <stop>
<start> critics such as malcolm <unk> and <unk> <unk> describe mixed emotions about the <unk> of the poem <unk> emphasised the mystical nature of the poem and how its themes were closer to buddhism than <unk> while mentioning his appreciation of many of the passages <unk> also mentioned the buddhist images and his admiration for many of the lines in little <unk> f. b. <unk> believed that the fourth section of the poem costs eliot more trouble and <unk> than any passage of the same length he ever wrote and is his greatest achievement in the four <unk> e. m. forster did not like eliot 's emphasis on pain and responded to the poem of course there 's pain on and off through each individual 's life ... you can 't <unk> it and so on but why should it be endorsed by the schoolmaster and <unk> by the priest until the fire and the rose are one when so much of it is caused by disease and <unk> it is here that eliot becomes unsatisfactory as a seer writing in <num> roger <unk> wrote that in little <unk> eliot achieved that for which he <unk> dante — namely a poetry of belief in which belief and words are one and in which the thought cannot be prized free from the controlled and beautiful language <stop>

<start> george steiner literary critic for the new yorker and the new york times had written about the holocaust in some of his previous books including <unk> <unk> <num> language and silence <num> and in <unk> 's castle <num> many of the ideas steiner expresses in the portage to san <unk> of <unk> were reworked from these earlier works steiner told new york times editor d. j. r. <unk> that this book arose out of his lifelong work on language central to everything i am and believe and have written is my <unk> ... that you can use human speech both to <unk> to love to build to forgive and also to torture to hate to destroy and to <unk> <stop>
<start> commenting on the controversy the book generated steiner admitted to literary journalist and critic ron <unk> author of explaining hitler that he too was disturbed by it adding that his fictional hitler had gotten the better of him <unk> or <unk> @-@ like he said that it felt like the book wrote me steiner also pointed out that the novella is not only about his thoughts on the holocaust but also about the horrific events that took place in countries like cambodia vietnam el salvador and <unk> my feeling is that one has to <unk> with the <unk> if one can <stop>

<start> this book is the only work of fiction by steiner to have been adapted for the stage <stop>
<start> reaction to the portage to san <unk> of <unk> was mixed anthony <unk> in the observer called it astonishing christopher booker of the daily telegraph described it as a powerful piece and english author a. s. <unk> said it was a masterpiece in explaining hitler ron <unk> called the portage a <unk> story referring to steiner 's <unk> hitler has having taken on a life of its own writing in time magazine otto friedrich described the book a <unk> fantasy of remarkable intensity adding that by not <unk> hitler 's speech steiner <unk> from the <unk> of traditional holocaust literature and ends the book on a note of bleak ambiguity <stop>
<start> morris <unk> of the new york times was more critical of the book calling it a <unk> and badly executed novel a <unk> distraction from the serious business of thinking through the <unk> <unk> of the nazi era he described it as <unk> that is <unk> d by too much fine writing <unk> @-@ <unk> he also complained that the characters are lifeless and while they each have detailed histories they are only verbal <unk> that do not separate them from one another finally <unk> noted that because almost all the points of hitler 's speech are drawn from some of steiner 's earlier works he unwittingly creates sympathy for hitler by making him old and pathetic yet also <unk> and brilliant — at once <unk> harmless and <unk> dangerous <stop>
<start> in another review in the new york times john leonard wrote that while the book has its strong points some wit a <unk> disdain multiplicity of character and a south american swamp @-@ life that <unk> its weaknesses are that the characters are really ideas ... the symbols clash and there are too many echoes of better books by <unk> and <unk> but leonard 's biggest criticism of the book was hitler 's speech which he called obscene and steiner 's decision to end the book at that point which leonard said not only denies the power of art to arrange and transcend but ... makes me sick to my stomach <stop>
<start> writing in the american literary magazine <unk> alvin h. <unk> called the portage a breakthrough work that <unk> he was struck by the book 's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle and the landscape of speech — the former being brilliantly registered with its immense feeling of <unk> and the latter even more dramatic in the way it exposes the dark underside of words and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person he was particularly impressed by the depiction of nazi hunter emmanuel <unk> and his role as representative of the jewish consciousness <unk> noted that while holocaust literature often either <unk> to <unk> and apostrophe or sinks to a <unk> <unk> of elegiac lament steiner 's <unk> <unk> between these two extremes ... simultaneously records and <unk> <unk> <unk> yet carries an immense affect what did concern the reviewer however was the way steiner used ideas from his earlier works that he had put them virtually <unk> into hitler 's mouth creating the impression that steiner 's understanding of hitler were identical with the latter 's self @-@ understanding <unk> also questioned why the book had to end with hitler 's speech he said that steiner 's <unk> hitler plays the devil 's game of language subversion making madness sound like music something the real hitler had <unk> by stopping at this point <unk> felt that steiner <unk> s <unk> to the seductive <unk> of negation which <unk> his own high standards of moral intelligence but overall <unk> said the portage must be counted among the most vigorous attempts to portray the presence and meaning of hitler forcing us to confront him in a way hardly seen before in fiction <stop>
<start> the portage to san <unk> of <unk> was a <unk> in the <num> <unk> faulkner award for fiction <stop>
<start> the book generated considerable controversy because of its apparent admiration for hitler the controversy grew further when the faithful stage adaptation too faithful according to steiner was performed in the united kingdom and the united states <stop>
<start> hitler 's speech at the end of the book disturbed many readers and critics steiner not only lets hitler justify his past he allows him the almost last word before the outside world invades the fact that steiner is jewish made this speech in particular even more contentious one critic while acknowledging that steiner always saw hitler as the incarnation of unprecedented and unparalleled evil felt that there was no clear distinction in the book between steiner 's own views and those of his fictional hitler even going so far as to accuse steiner who rejects jewish nationalism and is a critic of israel 's treatment of the palestinians of anti @-@ semitism <stop>
<start> in contrast a time magazine article at the time felt that steiner 's intention for the hitler speech was to use it to explore his previously stated belief that hitler wielded language as an almost supernatural force drawing attention to nazi hunter emmanuel <unk> 's warning from the book regarding hitler there shall come a man who ... will know the grammar of hell and teach it to others he will know the sounds of madness and <unk> and make them seem music <stop>
<start> steiner responded to criticism that hitler 's speech in this book is <unk> by saying that it had been done before for example satan 's speech in milton 's paradise lost <num> and the grand <unk> 's speech in <unk> 's the brothers <unk> <num> he also reminded the reader that hitler 's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by <unk> 's long monologue on the <unk> of the holocaust finally steiner said that his hitler a. h. is a <unk> figure and that it is not he who has the last word but <unk> the indian <unk> who shouts <unk> <unk> is also the hebrew word used to indicate that there are issues here beyond our wisdom to answer or decide <stop>
<start> <unk> from greek <unk> <unk> to cut and <unk> <unk> <unk> is a diverse <unk> of extinct small to giant <unk> — often considered primitive amphibians — that flourished worldwide during the <unk> <unk> and <unk> periods a few species continued into the cretaceous <unk> have been found on every continent during about <num> million years of evolutionary history they adapted to a wide range of habitats including fresh water terrestrial and even coastal marine environments their life history is well understood with fossils known from the <unk> stage <unk> and maturity most <unk> were <unk> although some were almost fully terrestrial returning to the water only to breed these <unk> were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land although <unk> are considered amphibians many had characteristics such as scales claws and armour @-@ like bony plates that distinguish them from modern amphibians <stop>
<start> <unk> have been known since the early 19th century and were initially thought to be reptiles they were described at various times as <unk> <unk> and <unk> although these names are now rarely used animals now grouped in <unk> were spread out among several amphibian groups until the early 20th century when they were found to belong to a distinct taxon based on the structure of their vertebrae <unk> means cut vertebrae as each <unk> is divided into several parts <stop>
<start> experts disagree over whether <unk> were ancestral to modern amphibians frogs <unk> and <unk> or whether the whole group died out without leaving any descendants different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of <unk> another group of early <unk> called <unk> or even as descendants of both groups with <unk> evolving from <unk> and frogs and <unk> evolving from <unk> recent studies place a family of <unk> called the <unk> as the closest relatives of modern amphibians <unk> in teeth skulls and hearing structures link the two groups <stop>
<start> many <unk> are much larger than living amphibians and superficially resemble <unk> others are smaller and resemble <unk> most have broad flat heads that are either blunt <unk> or elongated <unk> the skulls are rounded or triangular in shape when viewed from above and are usually covered in pits and ridges the rugged surfaces of bones may have supported blood vessels which could transfer carbon dioxide to the bones to neutralize acidic build up in the blood early <unk> <unk> would have had difficulty <unk> carbon dioxide from their bodies while on land and these dermal bones may have been an early solution to the problem many <unk> also have canal @-@ like grooves in their skulls called sensory <unk> the <unk> which usually run around the nostrils and eye <unk> are part of a lateral line system used to detect <unk> in water as <unk> animals most <unk> have small limbs with four toes on each front foot and five on each hind foot <unk> <unk> have larger thicker limbs and some even have claws one unusual terrestrial <unk> <unk> has relatively long limbs for its body and probably lived as an active runner able to chase prey <stop>

<start> the naming of these first specimens was disputed however leopold <unk> named the animal <unk> in <num> in <num> english <unk> richard owen referred to the genus as <unk> to describe its highly folded or <unk> teeth owen thought the name <unk> ought not to be retained because it recalls <unk> the idea of the mammalian genus <unk> or else a <unk> form of the tooth ... and because the second element of the word <unk> indicates a false affinity the remains belonging not to the <unk> but to the <unk> order of <unk> owen recognized the animal was not a <unk> reptile yet he also referred <unk> 's <unk> to the genus although the two genera both have similarly sized conical teeth <unk> was later found to be a crocodile @-@ like reptile additional material including skulls firmly placed <unk> as an amphibian <unk> also named <unk> <unk> in <num> basing it on partial <unk> or back portion of the skull in <num> he described a complete skull of s. <unk> that had the same teeth as his <unk> making it the first known complete skull of a <unk> because <unk> was named first it has precedence over the other names as a senior <unk> synonym <unk> is still used as the name of an unrelated <unk> <unk> <stop>
<start> <unk> and other similar animals were referred to as <unk> named like <unk> for teeth that were highly folded in cross section owen 's <unk> <unk> was later found at guy 's <unk> england by paleontologist william buckland other specimens were found in the red sandstone of warwickshire as more fossils were uncovered in england owen depicted these <unk> as the highest form of <unk> and compared them to <unk> which he considered the highest form of reptiles he also noted the large <unk> of the <unk> a unit of rocks that dates to the late <unk> were younger than more advanced reptiles in the <unk> and <unk> which are late <unk> in age owen used these fossils to counter the notion that reptiles evolved from a <unk> progression from early amphibians what he called <unk> fishes <stop>
<start> in addition to <unk> some of the earliest named genera included <unk> and <unk> in <num> <unk> in <num> <unk> in <num> <unk> and <unk> in <num> <unk> in <num> and <unk> in <num> <unk> is now placed as an early <unk> outside <unk> and <unk> is now considered a <unk> reptile <stop>
<start> later in the 19th century <unk> were classified as various members of <unk> a name coined by american paleontologist edward <unk> cope in <num> cope placed <unk> in the class <unk> the name then used for <unk> <unk> means roof @-@ headed in greek a reference to the wide flat heads of <unk> and other early <unk> during this time <unk> considered <unk> to be amphibians because they possessed three main features gill arches in juvenile skeletons indicating they were amphibious for at least the first part of their lives ribs that do not connect at the underside of the rib cage and deep pits in the skull that were interpreted as space for <unk> glands <stop>
<start> several <unk> of <unk> were recognized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries animals now regarded as <unk> were primarily <unk> but some were classified in the <unk> <unk> were small @-@ bodied and had simple conical teeth while <unk> were larger and had complex folded <unk> and enamel in their teeth <unk> included only a few forms such as <unk> from europe and <unk> from north america that had poorly developed bones external gills and no ribs some skeletons of <unk> were later found with long ribs prompting its <unk> to <unk> although more detailed studies found it to be a <unk> soft tissue such as scales and external gills were found in many well @-@ preserved <unk> fossils from germany in the early 20th century <unk> would be recognized as <unk> forms of <unk> lacking many of the typical features that define the group and is no longer recognized as a distinct group <stop>
<start> other animals that would later be classified as <unk> were placed in a group called <unk> characterized by plate @-@ like skull bones small limbs fish @-@ like scales and <unk> arches unlike <unk> they did not have parietal <unk> small holes in their skulls behind their eye <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> were placed in this group and were considered to be the most primitive members of <unk> their <unk> vertebrae <unk> and lack of <unk> <unk> which attached the head to the neck were features that were also shared with fishes thus they were considered a link between early fishes and more advanced forms such as <unk> <stop>
<start> another group called <unk> was named by cope in <num> cope classified <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> placing many small amphibian @-@ like animals within it among them were <unk> once placed in <unk> <unk> was later placed as a <unk> with other <unk> but confusion existed for many years over the classification of small amphibians <stop>
<start> by the end of the 19th century most of what are today regarded as <unk> were placed in the suborder <unk> american paleontologist <unk> <unk> case called it <unk> <unk> or true <unk> the names <unk> and <unk> were used <unk> to refer to the order in which it belonged the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> both of which contain <unk> were distinct from <unk> within <unk> were the groups <unk> <unk> and <unk> members of <unk> such as <unk> and <unk> had <unk> vertebrae with enlarged <unk> that displaced the <unk> <unk> such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> had lost their <unk> and the <unk> made up the entire body of the vertebrae <unk> had <unk> and <unk> that were of equal size <unk> are now identified as <unk> distantly related to <unk> <stop>
<start> in <num> von <unk> divided <unk> among three taxa <unk> <unk> and <unk> he placed <unk> in <unk> a group which he characterized as having simple <unk> @-@ shaped <unk> <unk> <unk> included forms with the <unk> divided into <unk> and <unk> all members of <unk> had <unk> <unk> composed only of the <unk> cope objected to von <unk> 's classification considering the vertebrae of <unk> and <unk> indistinguishable because each had a simple <unk> shape he continued to use <unk> and <unk> which he alternatively referred to as <unk> to distinguish animals based on the absence or presence of <unk> <unk> <stop>
<start> <unk> became a commonly used name at the turn of the century <unk> included both <unk> and <unk> in the group cope 's <unk> and <unk> fell out of use in <num> british paleontologist d. m. s. watson proposed that the evolutionary history of these large amphibians could be seen through changes in their vertebrae <unk> forms in the <unk> graded into <unk> forms in the <unk> and finally into <unk> in the <unk> more importantly watson began using the term <unk> to refer to these groups the name <unk> was rarely used in the decades that followed swedish paleontologist <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> removed <unk> from the group narrowing its scope to <unk> and <unk> his classification of <unk> was based heavily on characteristics of the skull rather than the vertebrae <stop>
<start> american paleontologist alfred <unk> brought the name <unk> back into use in the later 20th century <unk> @-@ <unk> used the name <unk> in a strict sense <unk> <unk> to refer to <unk> and <unk> excluding <unk> <unk> agreed with this classification but used the name <unk> to avoid confusion with <unk> in its wider sense <unk> <unk> unlike modern <unk> classification however <unk> included the primitive <unk> in the group <stop>
<start> <unk> first appeared in the early <unk> around <num> million years ago <unk> during the <unk> <unk> included basal medium @-@ sized forms such as <unk> or large <unk> forms such as <unk> other more derived <unk> such as the <unk> were smaller and more terrestrial they resembled <unk> and some taxa such as the genus <unk> even retained external gills like the modern @-@ day <unk> during the latest <unk> and early <unk> around <num> <unk> several groups such as the <unk> and <unk> evolved strong robust limbs and vertebrae and became adapted to life on land while others such as the <unk> developed into large <unk> predators the <unk> a group of small aquatic <unk> evolved from terrestrial ancestors in the late <unk> <stop>
<start> during the late <unk> increasing <unk> and the <unk> of reptiles contributed into a decline in terrestrial <unk> but <unk> and fully aquatic <unk> continued to <unk> including the large <unk> of eastern europe other <unk> such as <unk> developed long <unk> and a close similarity to <unk> although they lacked the armor characteristic of the latter group these <unk> included the largest known amphibian the <num> @-@ m @-@ long <unk> of brazil <stop>

<start> <unk> <unk> were often the dominant <unk> animals in their environments large <unk> of <unk> with hundreds of individuals preserved together have been found in the southwestern united states they have often been interpreted as mass death events caused by droughts in floodplain environments recent studies show these dense <unk> were instead probably the result of currents accumulating dead individuals in certain areas these environments seem to have had little diversity as they were inhabited almost exclusively by <unk> <stop>

<start> originally <unk> were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae early forms with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements were placed in the suborder <unk> and large <unk> aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder <unk> with the recent growth of <unk> this classification is no longer viable the basic <unk> condition is found in many primitive <unk> and is not unique to one group of <unk> moreover the distinction between <unk> and <unk> vertebrae is not entirely clear some <unk> have <unk> <unk> and <unk> vertebrae at different points in the same <unk> column other taxa have intermediate morphologies that do not fit into any category <unk> is no longer recognized as a group but <unk> is still considered valid below is a simplified taxonomy of <unk> showing currently recognized groups <stop>

<start> in one of the earliest phylogenetic analyses of the group <unk> <num> recognized five characteristics that made <unk> a clade a bone at the back of the skull the <unk> is connected to another bone on the underside of the skull the <unk> large openings called <unk> <unk> are present between the <unk> the <unk> a bone involved in hearing is connected to the <unk> and projects upward the <unk> a bone in the pectoral <unk> is thin and part of the <unk> called the <unk> <unk> to the neural arch additional features were given by godfrey et al <num> including the contact between the <unk> and <unk> at the back of the skull small projections <unk> processes on the ribs and a pelvic <unk> with each side having a single <unk> blade these shared characteristics are called <unk> <stop>
<start> <unk> are placed as basal <unk> in phylogenetic analyses with their exact positioning varying between studies depending on the classification of modern amphibians they are either included in the crown group <unk> or the stem of <unk> crown @-@ group <unk> are descendants of the most recent common ancestor of all living <unk> and stem <unk> are forms that are outside the crown group modern amphibians have recently been suggested as descendants of <unk> which would place them within crown <unk> below is a cladogram from <unk> et al <num> placing <unk> within crown <unk> <stop>
<start> other studies place modern amphibians as the descendants of <unk> and place <unk> in a more basal position within the stem of <unk> below is a cladogram from <unk> and <unk> <num> placing <unk> outside crown <unk> <stop>

<start> in <num> paleontologists adam <unk> and anne warren produced a revised phylogeny of more derived <unk> naming several new clades two major clades were <unk> and <unk> <unk> includes the <unk> that were once called <unk> and includes two subfamilies the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> include small mostly terrestrial <unk> that may be the ancestors of modern amphibians <unk> include larger <unk> like <unk> the second major clade <unk> includes most <unk> <unk> as well as some <unk> groups within <unk> are the superfamily <unk> and the most derived <unk> the <unk> <stop>
<start> <unk> and warren also named <unk> a clade of small aquatic <unk> from the <unk> <unk> and <unk> they placed <unk> within <unk> but more recent studies disagree on their position for example a <num> study places them even more basal than <unk> while a <num> study keeps them as basal <unk> <stop>
<start> within <unk> <unk> and warren erected two major clades <unk> and <unk> <unk> include large <unk> <unk> like <unk> with flat heads and eyes near the back of the skull <unk> include a diversity of <unk> including large marine <unk> aquatic <unk> <unk> that survived into the cretaceous and <unk> with eyes near the front of their heads in <num> paleontologists <unk> <unk> and andrew <unk> named a third major clade of <unk> the <unk> this group included more primitive <unk> that could not be placed in either <unk> or <unk> and included groups like <unk> <unk> and <unk> while <unk> and <unk> are still widely used <unk> is not often supported as a true clade in recent analyses <unk> and <unk> are now grouped with <unk> but <unk> are still considered to be a primitive family of <unk> <stop>
<start> a new phylogeny of <unk> was offered by paleontologist <unk> <unk> in <num> it supported many of the clades that were found by <unk> and warren but it did not find support for their division of derived <unk> into <unk> and <unk> <unk> were found to be more closely related to <unk> than to <unk> which were grouped with <unk> the clade including <unk> and <unk> was named <unk> in addition <unk> named the clade containing all <unk> except <unk> <unk> and reinstated the name <unk> for the clade containing all <unk> except <unk> and <unk> below is the cladogram from <unk> 's analysis <stop>
<start> modern amphibians frogs <unk> and <unk> are classified in <unk> <unk> appear to have arisen in the <unk> molecular clock estimates place the first <unk> in the late <unk> but the first member of <unk> frogs and <unk> but not <unk> is estimated to have appeared in the middle <unk> using the same technique using fossil evidence there are three main theories for the origin of modern amphibians <stop>
<start> one is that they evolved from <unk> <unk> another is that they evolved from <unk> most likely the <unk> a third hypothesis is that <unk> descended from <unk> and frogs and <unk> evolved from <unk> <stop>
<start> recently the theory that <unk> were the ancestors of all <unk> has gained wide support the skull morphology of some small <unk> has been compared to those of modern frogs and <unk> but the presence of <unk> <unk> teeth in small <unk> or immature <unk> has been cited as the most convincing argument in favor of the <unk> origin of <unk> <unk> in <unk> and many <unk> <unk> <unk> teeth have <unk> tips and bases during the development of most <unk> teeth begin to <unk> at their tips <unk> normally proceeds downward to the base of the tooth but <unk> from the tip stops abruptly in <unk> teeth <unk> resumes at the base leaving an area in the center of the tooth <unk> this pattern is seen in living amphibians and fossils <stop>
<start> the <unk> family <unk> is thought to be most closely related to <unk> in <num> an <unk> called <unk> <unk> was named from texas and was nicknamed the <unk> for its frog @-@ like head and <unk> @-@ like body it was thought to be the most closely related <unk> to <unk> and was placed as the sister taxon of the group in a phylogenetic analysis another species of <unk> called <unk> <unk> is now thought to be even more closely related to <unk> unlike <unk> <unk> was known since <num> and the presence of <unk> teeth in its jaws has led some paleontologists to conclude soon after its naming that it was a relative of modern amphibians it was first described as a <unk> and the specific name <unk> means connecting in reference to its inferred transitional position between <unk> and <unk> the structure of its <unk> a disk @-@ like membrane that functions like an ear drum is similar to that of frogs and has also been used as evidence for a close relationship other features including the shape of the palate and the back of the skull the short ribs and the smooth skull surface also point to it being a closer relative of <unk> than is <unk> below is a cladogram modified from <unk> and <unk> <num> showing the relationships of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <stop>
<start> although the earliest <unk> were primarily <unk> they had the ability to feed on land later <unk> and <unk> some well adapted to terrestrial life also fed on land some <unk> became better adapted toward life in water and shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms the first primarily aquatic <unk> were <unk> in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> became independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding <stop>
<start> most aquatic <unk> have flattened heads when feeding they probably opened their mouths by lifting their skulls instead of lowering their lower jaws the jaw mechanics of the <unk> <unk> is well known and is one of the most highly adapted <unk> is thought to have lifted its skull to around <num> ° above horizontal through the <unk> of the <unk> @-@ <unk> joint between the <unk> <unk> of the skull and the <unk> <unk> of the neck as the skull is raised the <unk> bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to <unk> outward other <unk> probably also lifted their skulls but they are not as well adapted for such movement <unk> watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in <unk> he envisioned that <unk> a much larger <unk> than <unk> was able to make the same movement <unk> <unk> <unk> also supported the idea in <num> suggesting that <unk> also fed in this way at the time it was thought that these <unk> lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral <unk> <unk> a close relative of <unk> also has a <unk> skeleton that muscles may have attached to <unk> has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull suggesting that it could <unk> feed by rapidly opening its mouth <stop>
<start> unlike <unk> <unk> terrestrial <unk> have skulls that are adapted for biting land @-@ living prey the <unk> between the bones of the skull in the <unk> <unk> are able to withstand a high degree of compression <unk> forces would have been experienced when biting down on prey earlier aquatic <unk> and <unk> ancestors differ from <unk> like <unk> in that their skulls were also built to withstand tension this tension would have been experienced during <unk> feeding underwater <unk> like <unk> were among the first <unk> that were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by biting <stop>
<start> <unk> like all amphibians reproduced in aquatic environments most <unk> probably reproduced through external fertilization like most living frogs female <unk> would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to <unk> them several fossils were described from the early <unk> of texas in <num> that may be egg masses of <unk> <unk> they were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs the fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably <unk> membranes and <unk> @-@ like areas surrounding them that are most likely <unk> coatings they are attached to plant fossils suggesting that these <unk> laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs the <unk> membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians not fish their eggs lack <unk> but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs the eggs are thought to be from <unk> because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians and probably had similar reproductive strategies they are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found <stop>
<start> one <unk> the <unk> <unk> may have <unk> young in an area between the gills called the <unk> <unk> small bones belonging to younger <unk> individuals have been found in these pouches the living darwin 's frog is also a mouth <unk> and would be the closest modern <unk> to <unk> if it cared for its young in this way an alternative possibility is that <unk> was <unk> eating its young like many amphibians do today if this was the case the bones of these smaller individuals were originally located in the throat and were pushed into the <unk> <unk> as the animal <unk> <stop>
<start> body impressions of early <unk> <unk> from pennsylvania suggest that some terrestrial <unk> mated on land like some modern amphibians they reproduced through internal fertilization rather than mating in water the presence of three individuals in one block of sandstone shows that the <unk> were gregarious the head of one individual rests under the tail of another in what may be a courtship display internal fertilization and similar courtship behavior are seen in modern <unk> <stop>
<start> while most types of <unk> are distinguished on the basis of features in mature specimens several are known from juvenile and <unk> specimens <unk> is seen in <unk> <unk> and <unk> with aquatic larvae developing into adults capable of living on land several types of <unk> do not fully <unk> but retain features of juveniles such as gills and small body size in what is known as <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> were also <unk> because they retained gills but they are only known from adult specimens <stop>
<start> <unk> larvae are often distinguished by poorly developed bones and the presence of a <unk> apparatus a series of bones that gills would attach to in life however some fully mature <unk> also possess <unk> bones but did not have external gills a dense covering of scales is also seen in larvae and adults major body changes occur in <unk> including the <unk> and strengthening of skull bones the <unk> of <unk> bones and an increase in body size <stop>
<start> <unk> like <unk> are known from both large adult specimens and small larvae showing an extreme change in body shape in these species the shape and proportions of skull bones change in the early stages of development the ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof also develops at this time small regularly spaced pits are the first to form followed by larger ridges as development continues the external gills disappear small teeth that once covered the palate are lost the <unk> skeleton does not develop at the same rate as the skull with ossification the replacement of cartilage by bone happening more slowly <unk> and limb bones are poorly developed ribs and fingers are absent in the early stages and the <unk> and <unk> are entirely absent through most of development once maturity is reached most bones have fully formed and growth rate slows the bones of some <unk> like <unk> show growth marks possibly an indication that growth rate varied with the change in seasons <unk> of <unk> like <unk> and <unk> show that individuals grew larger past maturity the oldest individuals usually have more <unk> on their skulls with deeper <unk> <stop>
<start> one group of <unk> the <unk> is also known from <unk> specimens <unk> like <unk> and <unk> are represented by many fossils preserving skin and external gills an entire growth series is exhibited in the wide range of sizes among specimens but the lack of <unk> adapted adult forms suggests that these <unk> were <unk> unlike other <unk> their <unk> skeletons developed quickly but were still partly <unk> when fully mature adults likely had an aquatic lifestyle similar to juveniles recently large specimens of <unk> <unk> were described with adaptations toward a terrestrial lifestyle indicating that not all <unk> were <unk> <stop>
<start> while most <unk> are aquatic in early stages of life most <unk> appear to have been terrestrial in their juvenile stage like other <unk> <unk> adult <unk> were adapted to a <unk> lifestyle their bones are not highly developed for movement on land the cross @-@ <unk> thickness of limb bones in adult <unk> shows that they could not withstand the stress of terrestrial <unk> <unk> individuals have bones that are thick enough to withstand this stress and could probably move about on land to maintain a terrestrial lifestyle a <unk> 's limb bones would have to <unk> with positive <unk> meaning that they would grow at a greater rate than the rest of the body this is not the case in <unk> meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifestyle <stop>
<start> <unk> and other early <unk> have rounded <unk> <unk> in the back of the skull that project into the cheek region in life the <unk> notch would have been covered by a membrane called the <unk> which is seen as a disk @-@ like area in living frogs the <unk> is involved in hearing and is similar to the ear drum of more advanced <unk> it was traditionally thought that the <unk> developed very early in <unk> evolution as a hearing organ and progressed to form the ear drum of <unk> thus <unk> possessed a hearing system supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles <stop>
<start> <unk> and all other living <unk> have a rod @-@ like bone called the <unk> that aids in hearing by transferring <unk> from the ear drum — or <unk> <unk> — to the inner ear <unk> also have a <unk> which projects into the <unk> cavity the <unk> likely evolved from the <unk> of lobe @-@ <unk> fishes the positioning of the <unk> and the shape of the <unk> region suggests that the <unk> of <unk> and frogs are <unk> but the <unk> of these amphibians are no longer considered <unk> with the hearing systems of reptiles birds and mammals therefore ear structures in <unk> were not ancestral to those of all other <unk> <stop>
<start> the ability of the <unk> and <unk> to effectively transmit <unk> is called <unk> matching early <unk> like <unk> have thick <unk> with poor <unk> matching so it is now thought that they were not used for hearing instead these thick <unk> may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the <unk> notch early <unk> like <unk> could not hear airborne sound but would have been able to detect vibration in the ground later <unk> like <unk> had <unk> regions adapted to hearing <unk> has a structure in the inner ear called the <unk> <unk> which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing its <unk> is also a better <unk> of sound the hearing system of <unk> and related <unk> was able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians <stop>

<start> the dvorak technique developed between <num> and <num> by vernon dvorak is a widely used system to estimate tropical cyclone intensity which includes tropical depression tropical storm and hurricane typhoon intense tropical cyclone <unk> based solely on visible and infrared satellite images within the dvorak satellite strength estimate for tropical cyclones there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower bounds on its intensity the primary patterns used are curved band pattern <unk> @-@ <unk> shear pattern <unk> @-@ <unk> central dense <unk> <unk> pattern <unk> @-@ <unk> central cold cover <unk> pattern banding eye pattern <unk> @-@ <unk> and eye pattern <unk> <unk> <stop>

<start> the initial development of this technique occurred in <num> by vernon dvorak using satellite pictures of tropical cyclones within the northwest pacific ocean the system as it was initially conceived involved pattern matching of cloud features with a development and decay model as the technique matured through the 1970s and 1980s measurement of cloud features became dominant in defining tropical cyclone intensity and central pressure of the tropical cyclone 's low @-@ pressure area use of infrared satellite imagery led to a more objective assessment of the strength of tropical cyclones with eyes using the cloud top temperatures within the eyewall and contrasting them with the warm temperatures within the eye itself <unk> on short term intensity change are used less frequently than they were back in the 1970s and 1980s the central pressures assigned to tropical cyclones have required modification as the original estimates were <num> @-@ <num> hpa <num> @.@ <num> @-@ <num> @.@ <num> inhg too low in the atlantic and up to <num> hpa <num> @.@ <num> inhg too high in the northwest pacific this led to the development of a separate wind @-@ pressure relationship for the northwest pacific devised by atkinson and holliday in <num> then modified in <num> <stop>
<start> as human analysts using the technique lead to <unk> biases efforts have been made to make more objective estimates using computer programs which have been aided by higher @-@ resolution satellite imagery and more powerful computers since tropical cyclone satellite patterns can <unk> over time automated techniques use a six @-@ hour averaging period to lead to more reliable intensity estimates development of the objective dvorak technique began in <num> which performed best with tropical cyclones that had eyes of hurricane or typhoon strength it still required a manual center placement keeping some <unk> within the process by <num> an advanced objective dvorak technique was developed which utilized banding features for systems below hurricane intensity and to <unk> determine the tropical cyclone 's center a central pressure bias was uncovered in <num> relating to the slope of the <unk> and cloud top temperatures which change with latitude that helped improve central pressure estimates within the objective technique <stop>
<start> in a developing cyclone the technique takes advantage of the fact that cyclones of similar intensity tend to have certain characteristic features and as they strengthen they tend to change in appearance in a predictable manner the structure and organization of the tropical cyclone are tracked over <num> hours to determine if the storm has weakened maintained its intensity or strengthened various central cloud and banding features are compared with <unk> that show typical storm patterns and their associated intensity if infrared satellite imagery is available for a cyclone with a visible eye pattern then the technique utilizes the difference between the temperature of the warm eye and the surrounding cold cloud tops to determine intensity colder cloud tops generally indicate a more intense storm in each case a t @-@ number an abbreviation for tropical number and a current <unk> <unk> value are assigned to the storm these measurements range between <num> minimum intensity and <num> maximum intensity the t @-@ number and <unk> value are the same except for weakening storms in which case the <unk> is higher for weakening systems the <unk> is held as the tropical cyclone intensity for <num> hours though research from the national hurricane center indicates that six hours is more reasonable the table at right shows the approximate surface wind speed and sea level pressure that corresponds to a given t @-@ number the amount a tropical cyclone can change in strength per <num> ‑ hour period is limited to <num> @.@ <num> t @-@ numbers per day <stop>
<start> within the dvorak satellite strength estimate for tropical cyclones there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower bounds on its intensity the primary patterns used are curved band pattern <unk> @-@ <unk> shear pattern <unk> @-@ <unk> central dense <unk> <unk> pattern <unk> @-@ <unk> banding eye pattern <unk> @-@ <unk> eye pattern <unk> <unk> and central cold cover <unk> pattern both the central dense <unk> and embedded eye pattern utilize the size of the <unk> the <unk> pattern <unk> start at <unk> equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity <num> miles per hour <num> km h the shape of the central dense <unk> is also considered the farther the center is <unk> into the <unk> the stronger it is deemed tropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds between <num> miles per hour <num> km h and <num> miles per hour <num> km h can have their center of <unk> obscured by cloudiness within visible and infrared satellite imagery which makes diagnosis of their intensity a challenge <stop>
<start> the <unk> pattern with its large and quickly developing mass of thick <unk> clouds spreading out from an area of convection near a tropical cyclone center within a short time frame indicates little development when it develops rainbands and cloud lines around the tropical cyclone weaken and the thick cloud shield <unk> the circulation center while it resembles a <unk> pattern it is rarely seen <stop>
<start> the eye pattern utilizes the <unk> of the cloud tops within the surrounding mass of thunderstorms and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself the larger the temperature difference is the stronger the tropical cyclone winds within tropical cyclones can also be estimated by tracking features within the <unk> using rapid scan <unk> satellite imagery whose pictures are taken minutes apart rather than every half @-@ hour <stop>
<start> once a pattern is identified the storm features such as length and <unk> of banding features are further analyzed to arrive at a particular t @-@ number <stop>
<start> several agencies issue dvorak intensity numbers for tropical cyclones and their precursors these include the national hurricane center 's tropical analysis and <unk> branch <unk> the national <unk> and <unk> administration 's <unk> analysis branch <unk> and the joint typhoon warning center at the naval pacific meteorology and <unk> center in pearl harbor hawaii <stop>

<start> the most significant benefit of the use of the technique is that it has provided a more complete history of tropical cyclone intensity in areas where aircraft reconnaissance is neither possible nor routinely available <unk> estimates of maximum sustained wind are currently within <num> miles per hour <num> @.@ <num> km h of what aircraft are able to measure half of the time though the assignment of intensity of systems with strengths between moderate tropical @-@ storm force <num> miles per hour <num> km h and weak <unk> or typhoon @-@ force <num> miles per hour <num> km h is the least certain its overall precision has not always been true as <unk> in the technique led to intensity changes between <num> and <num> of up to <num> miles per hour <num> km h the method is internally consistent in that it <unk> rapid increases or decreases in tropical cyclone intensity some tropical cyclones <unk> in strength more than the <num> @.@ <num> t numbers per day limit allowed by the rule which can work to the technique 's disadvantage and has led to occasional abandonment of the constraints since the 1980s systems with small eyes near the limb or edge of a satellite image can be biased too weakly using the technique which can be resolved through use of polar @-@ orbiting satellite imagery subtropical cyclone intensity cannot be determined using dvorak which led to the development of the <unk> @-@ <unk> technique in <num> <unk> undergoing extratropical transition losing their thunderstorm activity see their <unk> underestimated using the dvorak technique this led to the development of the miller and <unk> extratropical transition technique which can be used under these circumstances <stop>

<start> head vi is an oil @-@ on @-@ canvas painting by the irish @-@ born english <unk> artist francis <unk> the last of six panels making up his <num> head series it shows a bust view of a single figure modeled on diego <unk> 's portrait of innocent x. <unk> applies forceful expressive brush <unk> and places the figure within a glass cage structure behind curtain @-@ like <unk> this gives the effect of a man trapped and <unk> by his surroundings screaming into an <unk> void <stop>
<start> head vi was the first of <unk> 's paintings to reference <unk> whose portrait of pope innocent x haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of screaming <unk> a loose series of which there are around <num> surviving individual works head vi contains many motifs that were to reappear in <unk> 's work the hanging object which may be a light switch or curtain <unk> can be found even in his late paintings the <unk> cage is a motif that appears as late as his <num> – <num> masterpiece study for a self @-@ portrait — <unk> <stop>
<start> head vi was first exhibited in november <num> at the hanover gallery in london in a showing organised by one of the artist 's early champions erica <unk> at the time <unk> was a highly controversial but respected artist best known for his <num> three studies for figures at the base of a <unk> which made him the <unk> terrible of british art head vi drew a mixed reaction from art critics john russell later <unk> 's biographer at the time dismissed it as a cross between an <unk> <unk> of its jaws and an <unk> in <unk> @-@ <unk> who has come to a bad end in <num> lawrence <unk> wrote that the shock of the picture when it was seen with a whole series of heads ... was indescribable it was everything <unk> the paradoxical appearance at once of pastiche and <unk> was indeed one of <unk> 's most original <unk> art critic and curator david sylvester described it as a seminal piece from <unk> 's unusually productive <num> – <num> period and one of <unk> 's finest <unk> <stop>
<start> <unk> 's output is characterised by sequences of images he told sylvester that his imagination was stimulated by sequences and that images breed other images in me his series were not always planned or painted in sequence sometimes paintings are grouped for convenience but vary in execution and tone the idea for the head series came after he returned <unk> late in <num> from a stay in <unk> in the previous three years he had been unable to find a voice the last surviving canvas from this period is his painting <num> although he continued to paint he was a ruthless self critic given to <unk> <unk> with <unk> and no works survive from between <num> and the winter of <num> <unk> erica <unk> offered <unk> the opportunity of a solo show for the opening of her new hanover gallery he agreed but had nothing in reserve to hang in following years <unk> became perhaps the most important of <unk> 's early champions she arranged this showing — his debut solo exhibition — publicised him widely and organised <unk> for international <unk> <stop>
<start> already <num> years old <unk> viewed the exhibition as his last chance and applied himself to the task with determination because he had destroyed all his out of the last three years he had little choice but to present new works he did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show but eventually found themes that interested him in his head i of the previous year and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the november exhibition completing the series barely in time for the opening <stop>
<start> the paintings depict isolated figures enclosed in spaces that are <unk> overwhelmingly <unk> <unk> and eerie coming early in <unk> 's career they are uneven in quality but show a clear progression especially in how they <unk> and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with head i actually begun in the winter of <num> and head ii show <unk> pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads they have half @-@ open eyes and a <unk> though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human heads iii iv and v show fully formed <unk> recognisable as men and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere these two broad ideas <unk> in head vi which is as <unk> tortured as the first two paintings and as spectral as the middle three in head vi the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments the first indication in <unk> 's work of the influence of <unk> while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream <stop>
<start> <unk> said that chance played a significant role in his work and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge this was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in <unk> <unk> and poker rooms the following morning he would often approach his canvas in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous <unk> and drink i sometimes hardly knew what i was doing he incorporated his appetite for chance into his work an image often would <unk> mid @-@ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended he actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist to him lifestyle and art were intertwined he said that perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit <unk> this is very evident in the <num> series which began as a rather <unk> study of a collapsed head but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of <unk> masterpieces and arrived at an image that was to <unk> <unk> for the subsequent <num> years <stop>
<start> the series marks <unk> 's first attempt at depicting lone figures in rooms for him the key aspect was that it appeared that the subject felt isolated <unk> and had abandoned the need to present an outward face he believed that under these circumstances all <unk> falls away and the social being becomes the sum of its <unk> which <unk> attempted to convey by reducing the subject to its bare @-@ bones features a mouth ears eyes a jaw according to russell the view out front ceases to be the only one and our person is suddenly <unk> fragmented and subject to strange <unk> russell observed that while the depiction of figures in rooms is common through all eras of painting the figures are always posed and usually seemingly aware that they are being portrayed this <unk> is abandoned in <unk> 's series <stop>
<start> head i completed late in <num> is considered more successful than head ii although it is well @-@ regarded critically head ii is seen as something of a creative <unk> @-@ de @-@ sac while heads iii iv and v are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards head vi it is exceptional in <unk> 's <unk> that works of their relative poor quality survive he was <unk> self @-@ critical and often <unk> or abandoned <unk> before they were completed when pressed again by <unk> in <num> to produce works for a new york show that she had been <unk> for a year he was full of doubt and destroyed most of what he had been working on including several other <unk> <stop>
<start> <unk> commissioned another showing to be held in <num> for which <unk> painted three large <unk> modelled on <unk> 's portrait the gallery advertised the show as francis <unk> three studies from the painting of innocent x by <unk> but in the end <unk> was dissatisfied with the works and destroyed them before the show opened <stop>
<start> the figure is clearly identifiable as a pope from his clothing it seems trapped and isolated within the outlines of an abstract three @-@ dimensional glass cage this framing device described by sylvester as a space @-@ frame was to feature heavily throughout the artist 's career a <unk> hangs from the upper edge of the glass case falling just in front of the pope 's face and partially covering his eyes it is too <unk> drawn to identify with certainty but given the presence of similar objects in <unk> 's later works may be either the end of a hanging light switch or the <unk> of a curtain the hanging <unk> was to become a signature for the artist apart from its symbolic meaning it has a <unk> function framing the painting with a further set of vertical lines such an object reappears most prominently in the centre panel of his <num> <unk> may – june <num> where it is clearly a dangling light bulb for <unk> these elements were intended to make the figure <unk> in and out of sight for the viewer alluding to the fact that bulbs can be on or off <unk> open or closed <stop>
<start> the figure 's mouth is opened wide as if screaming an expression <unk> took from a still he kept of the nurse screaming in <unk> <unk> 's odessa steps massacre sequence in his <num> silent film battleship <unk> in <num> the broadcaster <unk> bragg asked <unk> about the still and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the <unk> of the human mouth <unk> replied i had always thought that i would be able to make the mouth with all the beauty of a <unk> landscape though i never succeeded in doing so when bragg asked why he thought he had failed <unk> said it should be all much more colour should have got more of the interior of the mouth with all the colours of the interior of the mouth but i didn 't happen to get it his interest in the mouth was further stimulated by a medical textbook of <unk> oral cavities bought in a second @-@ hand <unk> kept in his studio and to which he often referred to <stop>
<start> the glass cage might imply a vacuum that the figure 's voice is unable to escape as if it is screaming in silence <unk> later in life <unk> said that he had wanted to paint the scream more than the horror i think if i had really thought about what causes somebody to really scream it would have made the scream ... more successful the work evokes memories of the second world war the glass enclosure of his <num> chicago study for a portrait is often seen as <unk> photographs of adolf <unk> <num> trial before a jerusalem district court when he was held within a similar cage <unk> strongly resisted literal comparisons though and stated that he used the device so he could frame and really see the image – for no other reason i know it 's been interpreted as being many other things other critics saw similarities between the glass case and the radio <unk> of late 1930s broadcasters who warned against the impending <unk> denis farr notes that <unk> was sympathetic to george orwell and referred in interviews to <unk> shouting voices ... and trembling hands ... convey ing the harsh atmosphere of an <unk> <stop>
<start> the so @-@ called space frame had already been used by alberto <unk> in the 1930s and the two artists became friends in the 1960s however <unk> had by <num> used it only in <unk> contexts before <unk> 's <unk> and in turn influenced his use in the cage of <num> a similar two dimensional construct is found in henry moore 's works notably his <unk> for king and queen constructed three years after <unk> 's head it is difficult to <unk> how these artists influenced and informed each other what is notable is that <unk> continued to use the motif with intervals until the end of his life sylvester suggests his finest example is the <num> three studies of the male back <stop>
<start> the full @-@ length golden curtain @-@ like folds painted in heavy brush <unk> are in part influenced by <unk> but also similar to <unk> 's <num> portrait of cardinal filippo <unk> <unk> <unk> the old master 's device to isolate and distance the sitter from the viewer the black ground @-@ paint is visible through the folds making the separation all the more affecting <unk> had already used similar forms in his chicago panel and they were to become a feature of his most acclaimed 1950s works especially in his screaming <unk> he became fascinated with the veil or curtain as a motif in painting and collected many reproductions of works by <unk> and <unk> in which it is employed he had begun his career as an interior <unk> and designer of furniture and <unk> in the mid @-@ 1930s and later said that he liked rooms hung all round with just <unk> hung in even folds <unk> or <unk> appear in <unk> 's earliest works notably the <num> study from the human body always in portraits and always in front of rather than behind the figure <stop>
<start> head vi is closely modelled on <unk> 's c <num> portrait of innocent x today in the <unk> <unk> gallery rome <unk> cautiously avoided seeing the original even when he spent three months in rome in <num> critics speculate he was afraid of being disappointed or thought that an intimate knowledge of the painting would dull his imagination yet his fascination was all @-@ consuming and he reproduced variants of it <unk> for almost two decades an examination and homage described as without parallel in the history of art <unk> 's approach differs to <unk> 's in a number of ways both artists were expressive yet <unk> 's broad brush @-@ <unk> and freedom with paint contrast with <unk> 's tight and controlled treatment he <unk> <unk> 's positioning of the pope to place him above the viewer 's point of view elevating and <unk> him this was already a common technique in commercial promotional photography but in <unk> 's hands <unk> argues the angle places the pope on a kind of stage for the viewer to <unk> observe <stop>
<start> although <unk> revered <unk> 's portrait he did not try and reproduce the earlier painting in interviews he said that he saw flaws in <unk> 's work and that he viewed that social structure and order as according to art historian <unk> <unk> obsolete and decayed <unk> 's approach was to elevate his subject so he could knock him down again thereby making a <unk> comment on the treatment of royalty in both old master and contemporary painting yet <unk> 's influence is apparent in many aspects of the painting the sitter 's pose closely echoes the original as does the violet and white colouring of his cope which is built up through broad thick brush @-@ <unk> the influence can be further seen in the gold @-@ coloured ornaments on the back of the seat that extend on both sides of the figure art historian <unk> <unk> describes the work as a mixture of <unk> and subversion that pays tribute to <unk> while at the same time <unk> his painting <stop>
<start> sylvester <unk> the influence of late works by <unk> in other aspects especially in the deep and rich colouring <unk> 's portrayals of philip iv and agrees with identification of <unk> of edgar <unk> as a source he believes <unk> borrowed from <unk> the use of parallel heavy folds to create the illusion of what <unk> described as <unk> as seen in the earlier artist 's after the bath woman drying herself sylvester makes a further direct link between the folds and the transparent veil in <unk> 's portrait of cardinal filippo <unk> he believes the folds serve to push the viewer back creating a distance from the subject an effect he sees as similar to the separation between and orchestra and setting others view the folds as more closely resembling the bars of a prison sylvester describes them as an <unk> of background <unk> into stripes that are made to appear as if they pass through the sitter in his <unk> with francis <unk> series of books he asked <unk> why he found the effect so poignant the artist replied well it means that the sensation doesn 't come straight out at you but <unk> slowly and gently through the gaps <stop>
<start> when asked why he was compelled to revisit the <unk> so often <unk> replied that he had nothing against <unk> per <unk> but merely sought an excuse to use these colours and you can 't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false <unk> manner <unk> sees head vi as a reaction against <unk> and a commentary on how the papacy is obsolete and decayed with a pope resistant to both modernisation and <unk> to him the figure seems to resist the <unk> of image and tries to halt the impending collapse of the established work order he screams and <unk> clutching at arms of his throne sylvester notes that <unk> was impressed by picasso 's <unk> and handling of paint especially in picasso 's 1930s works and suggests that the white <unk> around the pope 's <unk> may be influenced by the <num> woman in a <unk> <unk> in an <unk> <stop>
<start> when <unk> undertook the series late in <num> he was something of a two @-@ hit wonder he had success in <num> with three studies for figures at the base of a <unk> and to a lesser extent with painting <num> both of which were highly regarded but viewed as <unk> the exhibition was a success and marked his critical breakthrough until then he had been highly regarded but capable of only occasional <unk> the full show established him in the minds of critics as according to michael <unk> more of a force to be <unk> with in the contemporary scene while some found his images <unk> and <unk> they wrote about him all the same sealing his reputation as the <unk> terrible of post @-@ war british art the critic for the observer wrote the recent paintings ... <unk> as they are cannot be ignored technically they are superb and the masterly handling of large areas of <unk> grey flushed with a sudden pink or green only makes me regret the more that the artist 's gift should have been brought to subjects so esoteric <stop>
<start> most critics focused on heads i and vi remarking favourably on the progression between the two while some found the inherent violence of the paintings <unk> <unk> was a skilled publicist and turned the bad press into notoriety and brought <unk> 's work to national attention <unk> notes that the exhibition showed <unk> no longer needed <unk> material to make an impact and was now capable of creating an intense emotional response through more subtle means and had found a way of presenting the human condition in the way he had sought by presenting his sitter in a <unk> setting a cage or behind a parted <unk> ... the rest the most essential lay in the manipulation of the infinitely <unk> medium of oil paint after the showing <unk> gradually became less the <unk> with an occasional image of <unk> <unk> and more a force to be <unk> with on the contemporary scene his reputation and the value of his panels rose dramatically and after the showing he was sought after by european american and african collectors and galleries commanding prices as high as £ <num> for single works unusual for a contemporary british artist of the time <stop>
<start> head vi was first exhibited at the hanover gallery london in <num> it was acquired by the arts council 's <unk> gallery in <num> the <unk> has loaned it out a number of times since including for major <unk> at the grand <unk> paris in <num> and the hugh lane gallery dublin in <num> <stop>
<start> in may <num> the national gallery took on loan <unk> 's innocent x portrait and hung it alongside four <unk> paintings head vi pope i <num> pope <num> and pope <num> <unk> believes that <unk> would have disapproved of such a showing with a work he considered one of the finest ever painted but writes that two including head vi stood up to it and even enhanced its authority as one of the most penetrating studies of human nature and human power <stop>
<start> <unk> was a movement in early 20th @-@ century anglo @-@ american poetry that favored precision of imagery and clear sharp language <stop>
<start> <unk> has been described as the most influential movement in english poetry since the activity of the pre @-@ <unk> as a poetic style it gave <unk> its start in the early 20th century and is considered to be the first organized <unk> literary movement in the english language <unk> is sometimes viewed as a succession of creative moments rather than any continuous or sustained period of development rené <unk> remarked that it is more accurate to consider <unk> not as a doctrine nor even as a poetic school but as the association of a few poets who were for a certain time in agreement on a small number of important principles <stop>
<start> the <unk> rejected the sentiment and <unk> typical of much romantic and victorian poetry in contrast to their contemporaries the georgian poets who were generally content to work within that tradition in contrast <unk> called for a return to what were seen as more classical values such as <unk> of presentation and economy of language as well as a willingness to experiment with non @-@ traditional verse forms <unk> use free verse <stop>
<start> <unk> publications appearing between <num> and <num> featured works by many of the most prominent modernist figures both in poetry and in other fields the <unk> group was centered in london with members from great britain ireland and the united states <unk> unusually for the time a number of women writers were major <unk> figures <stop>
<start> a characteristic feature of <unk> is its attempt to isolate a single image to reveal its essence this feature mirrors contemporary developments in avant @-@ garde art especially <unk> although <unk> <unk> objects through the use of what ezra pound called luminous details pound 's <unk> method of juxtaposing concrete instances to express an <unk> is similar to <unk> 's manner of <unk> multiple perspectives into a single image <stop>
<start> well @-@ known poets of the <unk> era of the 1890s such as alfred austin stephen phillips and william watson had been working very much in the shadow of tennyson producing weak imitations of the poetry of the victorian era they continued to work in this vein into the early years of the 20th century as the new century opened austin was still the serving british poet laureate a post which he held up to <num> in the century 's first decade poetry still had a large audience volumes of verse published in that time included thomas hardy 's the <unk> christina <unk> 's posthumous <unk> works ernest <unk> 's poems george meredith 's last poems robert service 's <unk> of a <unk> and john <unk> 's <unk> and poems future nobel prize winner william butler yeats was <unk> much of his energy to the abbey theatre and writing for the stage producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period in <num> the nobel prize for literature was awarded to <unk> kipling <stop>
<start> the origins of <unk> are to be found in two poems autumn and a city sunset by t. e. <unk> these were published in january <num> by the poets club in london in a booklet called for christmas <unk> <unk> was a student of mathematics and philosophy he had been involved in the setting up of the club in <num> and was its first secretary around the end of <num> he presented his paper a <unk> on modern poetry at one of the club 's meetings writing in a. r. <unk> 's magazine the new age the poet and critic f. s. flint a champion of free verse and modern french poetry was highly critical of the club and its publications from the ensuing debate <unk> and flint became close friends in <num> <unk> left the poets club and started meeting with flint and other poets in a new group which <unk> referred to as the <unk> club they met at the <unk> tower restaurant in london 's <unk> to discuss plans to reform contemporary poetry through free verse and the <unk> and <unk> and the removal of all unnecessary <unk> from poems the interest in japanese verse forms can be placed in a context of the late victorian and <unk> revival of interest in <unk> and <unk> as witnessed in the 1890s vogue for william anderson 's japanese prints donated to the british museum performances of <unk> plays in london and the success of gilbert and sullivan 's <unk> the <unk> <num> direct literary models were available from a number of sources including f. v. <unk> 's <num> <unk> <unk> is <unk> or <unk> by a century of poets being japanese <unk> odes the first english @-@ language version of the <unk> <unk> a 13th @-@ century anthology of <num> <unk> the early 20th @-@ century critical writings and poems of <unk> hartmann and contemporary french @-@ language translations <stop>
<start> the american poet ezra pound was introduced to the group in april <num> and found that their ideas were close to his own in particular pound 's studies of romantic literature had led him to an admiration of the <unk> direct expression that he detected in the writings of <unk> daniel dante and <unk> <unk> amongst others for example in his <num> – <num> series of essays i gather the limbs of osiris pound writes of daniel 's line <unk> de <unk> m <unk> <unk> it rests me to think of her from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 'l <unk> <unk> you cannot get statement simpler than that or clearer or less <unk> these criteria of <unk> clarity and lack of rhetoric were to be amongst the defining qualities of <unk> poetry through his friendship with laurence <unk> pound had already developed an interest in japanese art by examining <unk> @-@ e prints at the british museum and he quickly became absorbed in the study of related japanese verse forms <stop>
<start> in an article in la france <num> the french critic <unk> de <unk> described the <unk> as descendants of the french <unk> and in a <num> letter to the french critic and translator rené <unk> pound was keen to emphasise another ancestry for <unk> pointing out that <unk> was indebted to a <unk> tradition linking back via william butler yeats arthur symons and the <unk> club generation of british poets to <unk> and the <unk> source was amplified further in <unk> 's study published in <num> in which he concluded however great the divergence of technique and language between the image of the <unk> and the symbol of the <unk> there is a difference only of precision in <num> pound edited the poetry of another 1890s poet lionel johnson for the publisher <unk> mathews in his introduction he wrote <stop>
<start> in <num> pound introduced two other poets to the <unk> tower group his former fiancée hilda <unk> who had started signing her work <unk> and her future husband richard <unk> these two were interested in exploring greek poetic models especially <unk> an interest that pound shared the compression of expression that they achieved by following the greek example complemented the proto @-@ <unk> interest in japanese poetry and in <num> during a meeting with them in the british museum tea room pound told <unk> and <unk> that they were <unk> and even <unk> the signature <unk> <unk> to some poems they were discussing <stop>
<start> when harriet monroe started her poetry magazine in <num> she had asked pound to act as foreign editor in october <num> he submitted <unk> three poems each by <unk> and <unk> under the <unk> <unk> published in the november <num> second issue <unk> with a note which described <unk> as one of the <unk> this note along with the <unk> note the complete works of t. s. <unk> in pound 's book also published in autumn <num> entitled <unk> are considered to be first appearances of the word <unk> later <unk> to <unk> in print <stop>

<start> pound 's note opened with a definition of an image as that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time pound goes on to state it is better to present one image in a lifetime than to produce <unk> works his list of don <unk> reinforced his three statements in <unk> while warning that they should not be considered as <unk> but as the result of long contemplation taken together these two texts comprised the <unk> programme for a return to what they saw as the best poetic practice of the past <unk> flint commented we have never claimed to have invented the moon we do not pretend that our ideas are original <stop>
<start> the <num> preface to some <unk> poets comments <unk> does not merely mean the presentation of pictures <unk> refers to the manner of presentation not to the subject <stop>
<start> <unk> to promote the work of the <unk> and particularly of <unk> and <unk> pound decided to publish an anthology under the title des <unk> it was first published in alfred <unk> 's little magazine the <unk> and was later published in <num> by alfred and charles <unk> in new york and by harold <unk> at the poetry <unk> in london it became one of the most important and influential english @-@ language collections of modernist verse included in the thirty @-@ seven poems were ten poems by <unk> seven by <unk> and six by pound the book also included work by <unk> flint <unk> <unk> amy lowell william carlos williams james joyce ford <unk> ford allen <unk> and john <unk> <unk> was also another included in the important <num> anthology by william pratt the <unk> poem modern poetry in miniature <stop>
<start> pound 's editorial choices were based on what he saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with <unk> precepts rather than active participation in a group as such williams who was based in the united states had not participated in any of the discussions of the <unk> tower group however he and pound had long been corresponding on the question of the renewal of poetry along similar lines ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on pound as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier pre @-@ <unk> @-@ influenced style towards a harder more modern way of writing the inclusion of a poem by joyce i hear an army which was sent to pound by <unk> yeats took on a wider importance in the history of literary <unk> as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication at pound 's behest of a portrait of the artist as a young man in the <unk> joyce 's poem is not written in free verse but in rhyming <unk> however it strongly reflects pound 's interest in poems written to be sung to music such as those by the <unk> and <unk> <unk> the book met with little popular or critical success at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do and a number of copies were returned to the publisher <stop>
<start> the following year pound and flint fell out over their different interpretations of the history and goals of the group arising from an article on the history of <unk> written by flint and published in the <unk> in may <num> flint was at pains to emphasise the contribution of the <unk> tower poets especially edward <unk> pound who believed that the hellenic hardness that he saw as the distinguishing quality of the poems of <unk> and <unk> was likely to be diluted by the <unk> of <unk> was to play no further direct role in the history of the <unk> he went on to co @-@ found the <unk> with his friend the painter and writer <unk> lewis <stop>
<start> around this time the american <unk> amy lowell moved to london determined to promote her own work and that of the other <unk> poets lowell was a wealthy <unk> from boston whose brother abbott lawrence lowell was president of harvard university from <num> @-@ <num> she loved keats and cigars she was also an enthusiastic champion of literary experiment who was willing to use her money to publish the group lowell was determined to change the method of selection from pound 's <unk> editorial attitude to a more democratic manner this new editorial policy was stated in the <unk> to the first anthology to appear under her leadership in this new book we have followed a slightly different arrangement to that of our former anthology instead of an arbitrary selection by an editor each poet has been permitted to represent himself by the work he considers his best the only <unk> being that it should not yet have appeared in book form the outcome was a series of <unk> anthologies under the title some <unk> poets the first of these appeared in <num> planned and assembled mainly by <unk> and <unk> two further issues both edited by lowell were published in <num> and <num> these three volumes featured most of the original poets also including <unk> poetry by the american poet john gould fletcher with the exception of pound who had tried to persuade her to drop the <unk> name from her publications and who <unk> dubbed this phase of <unk> amy @-@ <unk> <stop>
<start> lowell persuaded d. h. lawrence to contribute poems to the <num> and <num> volumes making him the only writer to publish as both a georgian poet and an <unk> <unk> moore also became associated with the group during this period however with world war i as a backdrop the times were not easy for avant @-@ garde literary movements <unk> for example spent much of the war at the front and the <num> anthology effectively marked the end of the <unk> as a movement <stop>
<start> in <num> walter <unk> <unk> suggested that <unk> should produce a new <unk> anthology <unk> by now a successful novelist took up the suggestion and enlisted the help of ford and <unk> the result was the <unk> anthology <num> edited by <unk> and including all the contributors to the four earlier anthologies with the exception of lowell who had died <unk> who had disappeared and pound who declined the appearance of this anthology initiated a critical discussion of the place of the <unk> in the history of 20th @-@ century poetry <stop>
<start> of the poets who were published in the various <unk> anthologies joyce lawrence and <unk> are now primarily remembered and read as novelists <unk> moore who was at most a fringe member of the group carved out a unique poetic style of her own that retained an <unk> concern with compression of language william carlos williams developed his poetic along distinctly american lines with his variable foot and a diction he claimed was taken from the mouths of polish mothers both pound and <unk> turned to writing long poems but retained much of the hard edge to their language as an <unk> legacy most of the other members of the group are largely forgotten outside the context of the history of <unk> <stop>
<start> despite the movement 's short life <unk> would deeply influence the course of modernist poetry in english richard <unk> in his <num> memoir writes i think the poems of ezra pound <unk> lawrence and ford <unk> ford will continue to be read and to a considerable extent t. s. eliot and his followers have carried on their operations from positions won by the <unk> <stop>
<start> on the other hand wallace stevens found shortcomings in the <unk> approach not all objects are equal the vice of <unk> was that it did not recognize this with its demand for hardness clarity and precision and its insistence on fidelity to appearances coupled with its rejection of irrelevant <unk> emotions <unk> had later effects that are <unk> in t. s. eliot 's <unk> and morning at the window and in d. h. lawrence 's animal and flower pieces the rejection of conventional verse forms in the nineteen @-@ twenties owed much to the <unk> <unk> of the georgian poetry style <stop>
<start> the influence of <unk> can be seen clearly in the work of the <unk> poets who came to prominence in the 1930s under the auspices of pound and williams the <unk> worked mainly in free verse <unk> linking <unk> 's principles with <unk> 's louis <unk> insisted in his introduction to the <num> <unk> issue of poetry on writing which is the detail not <unk> of seeing of thinking with the things as they exist and of directing them along a line of melody <unk> was a major influence on the language poets who carried the <unk> focus on formal concerns to a high level of development basil <unk> another <unk> poet was a key figure in the early development of the british poetry revival a loose movement that also absorbed the influence of the san francisco renaissance poets <stop>
<start> <unk> influenced a number of poetry circles and <unk> the <unk> free verse became a discipline and acquired status as a legitimate poetic form in the 1950s especially with the beat generation the black mountain poets and others associated with the san francisco renaissance in his seminal <num> essay <unk> verse charles <unk> the theorist of the black mountain group wrote <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> his <unk> derived from and supplemented the <unk> <stop>

<start> <unk> after ambassador bishop 's visit to central command iraq invaded kuwait in <num> the us negotiated access to an airport and port in both mogadishu and <unk> because of limited access the us had to locations in the persian gulf area maintaining this access was a main interest for the mogadishu embassy to pursue as the us mobilized to intervene in kuwait <stop>
<start> an increasing level of criminal violence prompted ambassador bishop to request the voluntary evacuation of dependents e.g. children and spouses of staff and non @-@ essential staff in early december although fighting between the government and the united somali congress a rebel militia remained no less than about <num> miles <num> km away the voluntary evacuation later became a mandatory evacuation by <num> december the number of official us personnel in the city was reduced from <num> to <num> around the same time fighting between the government and rebels came within about <num> miles <num> km of mogadishu <stop>
<start> on <num> december violence escalated an order of magnitude as militants entered mogadishu which was quickly enveloped by a general state of lawlessness on <num> – <num> december diplomats including many stationed in offices elsewhere in the city were collected and housed in the embassy compound except two volunteers who remained in the embassy 's k @-@ <num> residential apartments located across <unk> road from the embassy the volunteers in the k @-@ <num> building would be needed as look @-@ outs for the embassy compound 's main gate on the morning of <num> december the defense <unk> was nearly killed when his vehicle was <unk> with bullets and that evening a soldier at a roadblock shot the <unk> of a vehicle carrying another defense official attempts by the us and other nations diplomats in particular the italian embassy to negotiate a ceasefire for foreigners to leave were unsuccessful <unk> road became a shooting gallery preventing those in safe @-@ <unk> outside the embassy from reaching it on new year 's day the first american civilians began to seek refuge at the embassy <stop>
<start> ambassador bishop requested an evacuation of the american community on <num> january indicating that the evacuation could be with the planned italian french or german evacuation efforts but preferred an evacuation by the us military the state department authorized the evacuation on <num> january and on that day ambassador bishop specifically requested an evacuation by the us military thereby initiating operation eastern exit ambassador bishop had spent a considerable amount of time discussing <unk> plans for evacuation with other diplomatic posts ultimately ten heads of missions — eight ambassadors and two <unk> d <unk> — along with their staff sought refuge in the us embassy compound and were evacuated <stop>
<start> ambassador bishop had visited central command in august <num> where he worked with military experts to update the embassy 's e e plan the first notice that an evacuation of the mogadishu embassy would be needed came on the morning of <num> january when the top naval commander at central command sent a message to his naval operations staff better have <unk> crowd take a look at a <unk> <unk> of mogadishu time distance to get there from <unk> <unk> area following the ambassador 's <num> january evacuation request the commander of central command ordered air force aircraft to the region the movement of amphibious ships to mogadishu and requested united states special operations command to prepare for a noncombatant evacuation operation <stop>
<start> the initial plan was to evacuate via mogadishu international airport soon after the evacuation request the united states air force deployed c @-@ <num> transport planes and an ac @-@ <num> for gunfire support to <unk> kenya awaiting clearances to enter somalia and the ability to safely transfer <unk> from the embassy to the airport however the us and other foreign embassies were unable to contact anyone within the government to obtain clearances it also became apparent that the rebels had an ineffective command @-@ and @-@ control structure making it impossible to negotiate any ceasefire or guarantee of safe passage likewise government troops faced a command @-@ and @-@ control problem reports indicated that army units were separating along clan lines in some cases soldiers shot officers of a different clan when given orders they disagreed with thus it became clear that safe passage to the airport would not be possible several other nations also had aircraft mobilized to reach mogadishu but faced the same problems of landing and transit of <unk> to the airport <stop>
<start> on <num> january several incidents including a couple exchanges of gunfire suggested that the embassy 's security detail was insufficient to hold off armed <unk> until the uss guam and uss <unk> arrived with their helicopters and soldiers at that time scheduled to arrive on <num> january the embassy had just six marine guards whose job was limited to protecting the <unk> ambassador bishop made an urgent request to washington for two platoons of soldiers to parachute into the embassy to defend it until the ships arrived the request was denied but the ambassador was told that an advance element from the vessels would reach the embassy the following morning <stop>
<start> uss guam and uss <unk> began transit from the coast of oman towards mogadishu at <num> <num> <num> <num> oman time on <num> january the commander of <unk> group two had initially proposed a seven @-@ ship <unk> task group composed of vessels anchored at <unk> island off oman and dubai and including four amphibious ships so that the full range of amphibious capabilities would be available for the operation however intervention in kuwait seemed imminent and the commander of naval forces at central command did not want to divert that many ships from the persian gulf thus the decision to send two of the closest ships although the two vessels were selected by mid @-@ afternoon on <num> january the transfer of some personnel from dubai to <unk> caused a delay of eight to ten hours guam and <unk> carried forces from the 4th marine expeditionary brigade including a detachment of ch @-@ <unk> super <unk> helicopters — the largest helicopters operated by the us military — and two squadrons of ch @-@ <num> sea knight helicopters <stop>
<start> planning began in earnest as the ships got underway with a combined command center on guam on the morning of <num> january the task force 's command questioned why they were not given the option of an amphibious landing and requested a tank landing ship be added to the task force the request was denied a warrant officer who had previously served as a marine security guard at the mogadishu embassy during the mid @-@ 1980s was found despite ambassador bishop 's planning with central command the task force was provided outdated information the former <unk> told planners that a new embassy had been planned and was under construction several years prior in fact the new embassy was located further inland and after receiving updated information task force commanders determined that a beach landing requiring troops to fight their way across the city was too risky initial plans had the ships launch their helicopters at <num> <num> on <num> january however in response to indications from ambassador bishop that conditions in mogadishu were deteriorating planners considered <num> @,@ <num> @-@ nautical @-@ mile <num> @,@ <num> km <num> @,@ <num> mi and later <num> @-@ nautical @-@ mile <num> @,@ <num> km <num> @,@ <num> mi flights with the ch @-@ <unk> while the ships were still located in the northern arabian sea the situation in mogadishu stabilized somewhat and the mission was delayed until <num> january <stop>
<start> on the evening of <num> january the final execute order was issued for a <num> <num> launch of two ch @-@ <unk> super <unk> to arrive at the embassy at dawn the <num> soldiers selected for the security detail were issued weapons and ammunition two marine corps <unk> @-@ <num> <unk> tankers were mobilized closer to the operation from bahrain to oman to refuel the helicopters en route to mogadishu and the two helicopters transferred from <unk> to guam <stop>
<start> two ch @-@ <unk> super <unk> carrying a <num> @-@ man security detail — <num> marines and nine navy <unk> — departed guam at <num> <num> <unk> nautical miles <unk> km <unk> mi from the embassy and were expected to arrive at <num> <num> they performed two aerial <unk> during the first <unk> a pipe burst on one of the helicopters <unk> soldiers in fuel and nearly forcing a return to the guam problems with the helicopters navigation system also complicated the <unk> rendezvous the helicopters arrived in mogadishu at dawn crossing the coast just south of the harbor at <num> – <num> feet <num> @.@ <num> – <num> @.@ <num> m in altitude on a route that was planned to avoid areas of more intense violence reported in the northern parts of the city on their arrival in mogadishu the crew of the helicopters were using an outdated <num> map which showed the embassy in an isolated area furthermore they had been told the embassy could be discerned by its white stucco perimeter wall and golf course the embassy was in fact surrounded by new development and the crew saw white stucco walls around many buildings in the city the helicopters were flying too low to spot a <unk> light which was placed on the embassy 's water tower the highest point within the embassy compound and the golf course in the embassy compound had a black oil @-@ coated surface — not the familiar green grass that the helicopter crew would <unk> breaking radio silence their only direct communication with the embassy was <unk> to contact the embassy they were able to <unk> it and land at <num> <num> as they arrived a group of about <num> to <num> <unk> were attempting to enter the embassy compound via <unk> on the wall but scattered as the helicopters arrived <stop>
<start> the security detail moved to establish a perimeter around the embassy compound and the air force 's ac @-@ <num> arrived to provide overhead support ambassador bishop gave the security detail clear instructions on the rules of engagement they could only use deadly force if people came over the embassy compound 's walls with obvious hostile intent he also identified three zones of defense stating a preference to retreat to the third zone before the use of deadly force <stop>
<start> the entire embassy compound <stop>
<start> the chancery joint administrative office <unk> building marine house and the helicopter landing zone <unk> <stop>
<start> the <unk> and <unk> buildings the two <unk> buildings where the <unk> were held <stop>
<start> ambassador bishop clearly explained his rationale to the security detail which was to avoid any impression that they were intervening in the violence in mogadishu he feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes got the impression that the us was intervening in the conflict to this effect he requested the voice of america and bbc broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere in the conflict the marines who had been <unk> in fuel during the <unk> were able to take a shower and wash their clothes <stop>
<start> after an hour on the ground the helicopters left with the first <num> <unk> including all american civilians and four heads of mission <unk> were provided blankets on one of the flights to remain warm <unk> with the only in @-@ flight <unk> on the return nearly prevented <unk> which would have forced the helicopters to divert to the somali desert and await a rescue at <num> <num> the helicopters arrived on guam and <unk> the <unk> <stop>
<start> no threats came upon the embassy during the day although <unk> of armed <unk> frequently drove by the embassy along <unk> road only one incident seemed to directly target the embassy a sniper and a <unk> were positioned on the embassy 's water tower the highest structure in the compound and came under fire they were ordered to not return fire and soon thereafter ordered to leave their position on the water tower <stop>
<start> the office of military cooperation just one and a half blocks from the embassy required evacuation despite its proximity to the embassy an armed convoy was needed to evacuate persons trapped there by the unrest a convoy of vehicles with several marines and <unk> left the embassy at <num> <num> and returned ten minutes later with <num> persons from the <unk> four americans a <unk> and <num> <unk> this was the only <unk> outside the embassy by the security detail throughout the day foreign diplomats contacted the embassy <unk> to be evacuated the us welcomed these requests but required all of them to find their own transportation to the embassy <stop>
<start> a somali officer who had a previous relationship with the embassy major siad agreed to travel to rescue the german <unk> d <unk> and british ambassador junior staff from the british embassy had previously come to the us embassy the soviet union was unable to land a plane in mogadishu the previous day and the soviet ambassador asked ambassador bishop if he and his staff could be rescued ambassador bishop a tennis partner of his soviet counterpart agreed but only if they found their own way to the embassy seeing the helicopters on the morning of <num> january they realized the americans would not remain in the city much longer at the request of ambassador bishop major siad agreed to transport the soviets but only if he was paid enough the us embassy paid major siad who returned with the soviet ambassador and <num> of his staff the brother of president barre who was also a major general and chief of police showed up at the embassy in the afternoon with <num> members of his family requesting to be evacuated but was turned away after a vocal conversation with the ambassador <stop>
<start> the operation did not include soldiers to handle the evacuation control center <unk> which was set up in the <unk> a <num> @-@ person force consisting primarily of soldiers to handle the <unk> was planned for insertion with the ch @-@ <unk> super <unk> after they had returned to the guam however this was cancelled over objections from the commander of the security detail the deficit was partially handled by embassy staff who assisted a few soldiers from the security detail the <unk> were grouped into <num> @-@ person sticks to be loaded onto the helicopters and were limited to one piece of luggage apiece some attempted to bring more resulting in problems coordinating their evacuation furthermore many <unk> had pets they wanted to bring which were not allowed most pets were killed by their owners some were given poison meanwhile the soldiers were allowed to consume anything they wanted from the embassy 's <unk> such as candy <unk> and souvenirs most had been stationed on ships for several months they were also allowed use or take anything they needed from the embassy the <unk> filled several bags with medical supplies to return to the ship <stop>
<start> as evening approached work began to prepare the <unk> for the main evacuation the area was used as a parking lot and several vehicles were left without keys by staff that had already been evacuated some cars had to be broken into to be moved chemical lights were placed in the <unk> in a nato y pattern the entire mission would be conducted with night vision <unk> which required all lights in the embassy compound to be turned off <stop>
<start> the main evacuation occurred in the early morning hours of <num> january and consisted of four waves of five ch @-@ <num> helicopters the timing of this phase was determined by range of the ch @-@ <num> sea knight which lack aerial <unk> capability the ships were about <num> – <num> nautical miles <num> – <num> km <num> – <num> mi away during this phase an ac @-@ <num> was sent from saudi arabia to provide gunfire support during the evacuation and two <unk> @-@ <num> iroquois helicopters were on standby to provide gunfire support but were not deployed <stop>
<start> the first wave departed guam at <num> <num> as the second wave landed major siad arrived at the embassy gate accompanied by two <unk> of soldiers and held a grenade in one hand and a radio in the other his request to speak with the ambassador was granted major siad demanded that the evacuation cease immediately because the somali government had not granted the us permission to carry out such a military operation he claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down the helicopters if the operation continued the second and third waves were able to depart without incident as the ambassador negotiated with the major who finally agreed to settle the matter for several thousand dollars in cash and keys to the ambassador 's armored car ambassador bishop remained engaged in conversation with the major until he reached the helicopter landing zone to depart with the final wave to prevent the major from <unk> on the deal the final wave departed the embassy at <num> <num> and landed on guam at <num> <num> twenty minutes later ambassador bishop declared the evacuation complete <stop>
<start> armed <unk> were observed entering the embassy compound as the final wave departed the doors of the <unk> — the main building of the embassy — were reportedly blown open by <unk> within two hours of the embassy 's evacuation somali employees of the embassy — known as foreign service <unk> <unk> — could not be evacuated ambassador bishop tried unsuccessfully to have these employees <unk> to safer parts of somalia many of the <unk> had sought refuge in the embassy with their families and about <num> were hired as guards and protected the embassy throughout the ordeal local banks had been closed for some time and the embassy was unable to pay the <unk> the ambassador left the <unk> with keys to the <unk> and warehouse on the embassy compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed <stop>
<start> a total of <num> <unk> were taken from the embassy including <num> heads of missions eight ambassadors and four <unk> d <unk> and <num> americans including ambassador bishop and <num> embassy staff the heads of mission were the ambassadors of the united states kenya nigeria soviet union sudan turkey united arab emirates and united kingdom and the <unk> of the embassies of germany kuwait oman and <unk> <stop>
<start> rather than disembark in nearby <unk> as originally thought by the <unk> the ships were ordered back to oman — a five @-@ day journey the sailors and marines made way for the <unk> to share living quarters when the <unk> of guam asked crew to sign up as guides for the <unk> while aboard the vessel two hundred signed up within an hour and some of the sailors even dressed up as <unk> to ease the ordeal for children at the request of the ambassadors a formal session with the ships senior officers was held to express their thanks on <num> january the <unk> were <unk> at muscat oman that afternoon the american <unk> were flown to frankfurt germany from where they continued home <stop>
<start> the <num> <unk> shield was the 57th <unk> shield tournament the premier baseball competition in australia and was held from <num> november <num> to <num> february <num> it was hailed as the precursor to the new australian baseball league that will start in the place of the <unk> shield in late <num> to early <num> the victoria <unk> defeated south australia two games to nil in the championship series to win the tournament this was the 22nd time the <unk> shield had been awarded to a victorian team the competition was sponsored by <unk> 's <unk> <stop>

<start> in june <num> it was announced that the rights to the <unk> shield had been sold to a new australian baseball league <unk> with ownership split between major league baseball 's <num> percent share and the <num> percent share owned by the australian baseball federation the <num> tournament was considered preparation for the inaugural <unk> season starting in <num> – <num> it varied from the <num> <unk> shield by expanding the season to include ten rounds since an uneven number five teams were involved four teams paired off for each round and played a three @-@ game series while the remaining team took a bye during the season each team had two bye rounds and played two rounds against each other team one at home and one away in total the schedule allowed for <num> regular @-@ season games per team before a postseason similar to the <num> edition the first @-@ place team directly qualified for the championship series and played against the winner of a playoff series between the second- and third @-@ place teams <stop>

<start> on march <num> <num> <unk> from the university college london at the tropical storm risk <unk> <unk> issued an extended range forecast for the typhoon season noting the likelihood of near average tropical cyclone activity as a result of projected neutral sea surface temperatures the forecast indicated the potential for <num> @.@ <num> tropical storms compared to the <num> – and <num> @-@ year average of <num> @.@ <num> and <num> @.@ <num> storms respectively the following month the group raised their forecast for tropical storms to <num> @.@ <num> indicating a slightly above average season over next two months however fluctuations in sea surface temperatures particularly those in the central pacific caused the group to revise their predictions downward and indicated the probability for a slightly below average typhoon season in their june forecast a rise in sea surface temperatures in the following months prompted the forecasting group to once again raise their <unk> to indicate a near @-@ average season in their final august forecast update which predicted <num> tropical storms the group was very accurate in their <unk> with their april and august <unk> being the most accurate <stop>
<start> similarly <unk> working with the city university of hong kong issued a seasonal projection on april <num> <num> indicating the likelihood of a normal or below normal season with <num> total tropical cyclones <num> tropical storms and <num> <unk> as with the <unk> the group primarily based their forecast numbers on the prevailing status of the el niño @-@ southern <unk> the city university of hong kong revised their <unk> on june <num> <num> indicating a slight increase of total tropical cyclones to <num> the group was also accurate in their <unk> for the entirety of the northwest pacific though their specialized <unk> for the south china sea were substantially off <stop>
<start> during the year the japan meteorological agency jma issued advisories on tropical cyclones west of the international date line to the malay peninsula and north of the equator this was due to the agency 's status as the official regional <unk> meteorological center as designated by the world meteorological organization in <num> the jma issued <unk> and analyses four times a day beginning at <num> utc and continuing every six hours the jma issued <unk> based on a <unk> tropical cyclone forecast model the agency estimated <num> minute sustained winds and barometric pressure based on the dvorak technique and numerical weather prediction the jtwc also issued warnings on storms within the basin operating from pearl harbor in hawaii to represent the interests of the united states armed forces in the indian and pacific <unk> <stop>

<start> the season began with the formation of tropical storm <unk> on january <num> after its <unk> five days later no tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity developed over the next two months this period of inactivity ended with the formation of typhoon <unk> in mid @-@ april <unk> was one of the longest lived pacific storms on record and was the first typhoon with <num> @-@ minute sustained winds of at least <num> km h <num> mph in april since typhoon isa in <num> tropical activity was enhanced from may to june and during this period the jma monitored four tropical storms while the pagasa monitored a fifth storm off the eastern philippines three of the four tropical storms monitored by the jma approached or hit japan including typhoon <unk> which brought heavy rainfall and wind across the <unk> islands and the korean peninsula <stop>
<start> tropical activity once again declined towards the second half of june and first half of july the second half of july however featured the development of <unk> imbudo and <unk> which both tracked westward across the philippines before striking areas near <unk> and other regions of southeastern china imbudo caused the deaths of <num> people and us <unk> million in damage august was a highly active month for tropical cyclogenesis with a total of six tropical storms monitored by the jma jtwc and pagasa this included <unk> <unk> and <unk> which also struck southeastern china typhoon <unk> earlier in the month made landfall in japan resulting in <num> deaths <stop>

<start> napoleon had calculated that <unk> would withdraw toward vienna expecting reinforcements from russia he envisioned that the armies would engage in a great battle at vienna and that this battle would decide the war consequently napoleon drew divisions from four of the other seven corps of the grande <unk> to create a new viii corps this corps was to secure the north shore of the <unk> block any of the austrian or russian groups from reinforcing one another and more importantly prevent <unk> from crossing the river and escaping to russia <stop>
<start> the new viii corps under the overall command of <unk> <unk> included three infantry divisions and a division of cavalry see order of battle below corps <unk> as it was known crossed the <unk> at <unk> and <unk> in early november <num> and marched east on the north bank of the <unk> operating independently the <unk> 's cavalry conducted reconnaissance ahead of them and on the flanks gen. <unk> 's division about <num> @,@ <num> men took the lead <unk> was with them they were followed by gen. <unk> 's division another <num> @,@ <num> about one day 's march behind jean @-@ baptiste <unk> 's division another <num> @,@ <num> marching another day behind <unk> brought up the rear a flotilla of <num> boats acquired at <unk> provided communications across the <unk> before sending <unk> on his mission napoleon instructed him to protect his north flank at all times against possible russian reinforcements advice he reiterated in subsequent written orders napoleon also advised <unk> to secure all <unk> of the <unk> between <unk> and vienna <stop>
<start> on <num> november <unk> 's division reached <unk> an der <unk> and covered the <num> kilometers <num> mi to <unk> by early on the following afternoon here it <unk> with some russian patrols to the east of the town and expelled them feeling confident the french established a forward post just upstream from stein in <unk> itself <unk> set up his command post and directed the establishment of a small field hospital although the position seemed secure he had ignored napoleon 's strict instructions and neglected to protect his left north flank <stop>
<start> this failure was an important factor when <unk> lost his corps so @-@ called eyes after he and <unk> had crossed the <unk> the french <unk> had <unk> to the northwest leaving only three squadrons of the 4th <unk> available for reconnaissance these had left the division and were operating independently of <unk> 's command consequently <unk> and <unk> marched <unk> through the narrow canyon west of <unk> not knowing what lay ahead of them <unk> had led the coalition army across the <unk> at <unk> a short distance past stein and destroyed the bridge behind him his actions deprived the french commanders of a possible route across the <unk> putting the deployment of the entire french division at further risk in the case of retreat in this decision <unk> abandoned vienna to the french who were <unk> on the austrian capital from the north west and southwest for the security of uniting with reinforcements from <unk> <unk> chose a military solution over a political one <stop>

<start> initially <unk> made rapid progress but he quickly recognized that the opposing force was much stronger than the typical rear guard of a retreating army realizing he had been <unk> and that <unk> 's troops were tiring rapidly <unk> sent orders to <unk> 's division to <unk> forward by mid @-@ morning the french momentum had stalled <unk> committed most of his remaining forces to driving <unk> back leaving a single <unk> <num> <unk> cover his northern flank and sent the rest to attack the russian right within <num> minutes he achieved the superiority of numbers he sought his <num> @,@ <num> french opposed <num> @,@ <num> russians and forced them back toward stein while pressing an attack along the river <unk> had no option for neither <unk> 's nor <unk> 's flanking columns were to be seen <stop>
<start> at this stage of the battle fighting paused <unk> and <unk> waited for <unk> 's arrival while <unk> and <unk> waited for <unk> 's and <unk> 's <unk> 's column was expected to be the last to join the fight because it had to march the greatest distance the timing of the respite varies depending on whose reports are consulted fighting paused at around <num> <num> or <num> <num> <unk> arrived first and immediately assaulted <unk> 's line with three battalions pushing the french out of <unk> caught between two strong forces <unk> attempted to push his way back through <unk> to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted troops <unk> through the narrow <unk> canyon and fighting off the russian force at their rear <unk> and his division were trapped when more of <unk> 's russians appeared to block their retreat the narrow <unk> hampered the russians <unk> 's men had to march out of the canyons form ranks and attack in waves despite <unk> 's continuous assault in the next two to three hours <unk> and <unk> pushed the russians back up the narrow <unk> in the hillside at this point <unk> 's column appeared behind the french line and joined the battle the french were outnumbered more than three to one assaulted in the front by <unk> 's column in the middle by <unk> 's and in the rear by <unk> <stop>
<start> earlier in the morning <unk> had proceeded with his column south and east along the river from <unk> according to instructions even before the arrival of <unk> 's <unk> he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause they came back to report that a russian column <unk> 's was descending from the mountains to take the road to <unk> realizing this would separate him from the forward division <unk> <unk> his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the russians in the flank the french assault heralded by cannon fire caused <unk> 's troops to turn their attention from <unk> 's <unk> force to face these new <unk> although superior in numbers <unk> 's column had no supporting artillery and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size it was <unk> 's turn to face attackers at his front and rear until the arrival of <unk> 's column which had <unk> its way through the mountains in the west <stop>
<start> <unk> arrived at dusk and the action continued well after dark in mid @-@ november night falls at close to <num> <num> in the upper <unk> <unk> despite the darkness <unk> descended out of the <unk> and deployed his troops to <unk> <unk> 's flank as his russians entered the <unk> they came between a battalion of french and another of russians with the additional force the french were overwhelmed but most of the shooting subsided when the combatants could not tell apart friend from <unk> in the dark under the cover of darkness <unk> used the french flotilla to evacuate his exhausted troops to the south bank the french and russians continued to <unk> <unk> into the night as <unk> encountered one another in the dark <unk> of <unk> 's force provided any necessary rear guard action and the following morning the remaining men were evacuated from the north shore of the <unk> while they maintained possession of only <unk> and <unk> on the north bank <stop>
<start> the losses were <unk> <unk> lost close to <num> percent of his division to death and wounds aside from losing five guns <num> officers and <num> men under his command were captured bringing the loss of <unk> closer to <num> percent furthermore he lost the eagles of the 4th infantry regiment france and the eagle and <unk> of the 4th <unk> the russians lost around <num> @,@ <num> about <num> percent of their force and two regimental colors the austrian lieutenant field marshal <unk> was killed as the battle concluded probably by russian <unk> in the confused melee the vineyards and the villages of <unk> and <unk> were destroyed as was most of <unk> and stein <unk> was heavily damaged the french plundered the town at least twice and <unk> handled its inhabitants <stop>
<start> both sides claimed victory although losses were fairly equal in terms of <unk> wounded or dead on each <unk> coalition forces went into battle with <num> @,@ <num> men while the french started with <unk> 's division of about <num> @,@ <num> which grew close to <num> @,@ <num> when <unk> 's men joined the fighting in the afternoon regardless <unk> 's division was nearly destroyed the <num> percent losses experienced by the french fell predominantly on his division <unk> for both sides the fighting was hard the weather had been cold an early storm had left slick icy mud in the roadways and <unk> like chandeliers hung from the trees <stop>
<start> for the coalition the russians were secure on the north bank of the <unk> awaiting reinforcements from <unk> the bridges between <unk> and vienna had been destroyed making french access to the austrian capital more difficult but not impossible after six months of fighting in which the austrians had enjoyed little good news the coalition could claim a difficult and timely victory the french had retreated from the field with a badly <unk> division and <unk> had secured the right flank indeed francis was so pleased with the outcome at <unk> that he awarded <unk> the military order of maria <unk> <stop>
<start> for the french the survival of the corps <unk> seemed nothing short of a miracle the remainder of <unk> 's division crossed the river the next morning and eventually <unk> in vienna which the french acquired by deception later in the month more importantly for them the french force had performed well over difficult terrain and under terrible combat conditions initially there had been some panic and parts of at least one french battalion had tried to escape on the flotilla craft they had lost control of the boats in the current and smashed into the pillars of the burned bridge at <unk> <unk> their boats <unk> into the icy river most had drowned despite this initial panic <unk> 's column retained its cohesion and responded well to various difficult demands <unk> had demonstrated his tactical <unk> when he heard cannon fire he directed his troops toward it to support the french division in terms of french staffing <unk> 's failure to guard his flank especially in the face of napoleon 's direct advice adversely influenced his relationship with his commander however in the immediate weeks ahead the flamboyant <unk> did more to annoy napoleon than <unk> had in assessing the battle and its aftermath historians have laid the blame and credit for its outcome not only on <unk> and <unk> napoleon aware of <unk> 's danger and his own <unk> for it vented his frustration on <unk> whom he unjustly accused of abandoning <unk> for the empty glory of riding through vienna <stop>
<start> after the victory at <unk> napoleon dispersed the viii corps and reassigned <unk> however disappointed he may have been with <unk> napoleon was pleased with <unk> 's performance as recognition of his conduct in what the french called the immortal battle of <unk> <unk> received the officer 's grand cross of the legion of honor <stop>
<start> the loss of <unk> was a significant blow to the austrian military organization called out of retirement for this specific task he was one of their most experienced general staff officers other than the <unk> charles from the summer of <num> until his retirement in <num> he had been chief of the <unk> general staff of the army the lower rhine the rhine and the army of germany furthermore he was a trusted member of <unk> charles staff he had helped to design several of charles more important victories at <unk> <unk> the <unk> at <unk> and <unk> the battles at <unk> and <unk> and the northern swiss campaign of <unk> that included battles at <unk> and <unk> an experienced officer and excellent <unk> he might well have made a more effective chief of the <unk> general staff of the coalition army at the battle of <unk> than his eventual replacement franz von <unk> in <unk> 's absence <unk> the architect of the austrian catastrophe at <unk> in <num> was chosen to develop the general battle plan of coalition action at <unk> <unk> undoubtedly a far better <unk> than <unk> and possessed of superior training and mapping skills would have developed a more realistic coalition plan for <unk> <unk> 's presence would probably not have been enough to turn that defeat into a victory but it would have <unk> the magnitude of the coalition 's losses <unk> was considered one of napoleon 's finest <unk> <stop>
<start> in the broader picture despite the important major naval engagements the outcome of the war of the third coalition was determined on the continent predominantly in the two major land operations in the ulm campaign the habsburgs achieved some minor victories such as <unk> 's at <unk> @-@ <unk> but ultimately lost an entire army and an officer corps the latter would not resume arms against france until formally exchanged this condition crippled the austrian military leadership and forced the recall of such pensioners as <unk> out of retirement after the capitulation at ulm isolated portions of the austrian military <unk> capture and joined with their russian allies michael von <unk> 's corps slipped out of the <unk> and joined <unk> 's force a few other small forces refused to <unk> and seemingly melted into the bavarian mountains and the <unk> forests to reappear in bohemia for <unk> sixteen hundred cavalry including <unk> ferdinand and prince <unk> broke out of ulm before its capitulation maximilian count of <unk> led his column back through the mountains into austria fighting rear guard actions against pursuing french forces at the <unk> <unk> and <unk> these elusive units were insufficient to balance heavy losses at key battles in which the austrians could not hold their own against the french between the ulm capitulation and the austrian and russian defeat at <unk> there were other minor achievements a successful <unk> between the cavalry that escaped from ulm and the french near the town of <unk> the contested victory at <unk> and another within days at <unk> <stop>
<start> the second determining event the decisive french victory at the battle of <unk> over the combined russian and austrian armies forced the austrian withdrawal from the coalition the subsequent peace of <unk> signed on <num> december <num> reinforced the earlier treaties of <unk> <unk> and <unk> furthermore austria ceded land to napoleon 's german allies and paid an indemnity of <num> million francs victory at <unk> also gave napoleon the latitude to create a <unk> zone of german states between france and the states of prussia russia and austria these measures did not establish a lasting peace on the continent prussian worries about growing french influence in central europe sparked the war of the fourth coalition in <num> in which austria did not participate <stop>

<start> constant k <unk> also k @-@ type <unk> are a type of electronic filter designed using the image method they are the original and simplest <unk> produced by this methodology and consist of a ladder network of identical sections of passive components historically they are the first <unk> that could approach the ideal filter frequency response to within any prescribed limit with the addition of a sufficient number of sections however they are rarely considered for a modern design the principles behind them having been superseded by other methodologies which are more accurate in their prediction of filter response <stop>
<start> constant k <unk> were invented by george campbell he published his work in <num> but had clearly invented the <unk> some time before as his colleague at at t co otto <unk> was already making improvements to the design at this time campbell 's <unk> were far superior to the simpler single element circuits that had been used previously campbell called his <unk> electric wave <unk> but this term later came to mean any filter that passes waves of some frequencies but not others many new forms of wave filter were subsequently invented an early and important variation was the m @-@ derived filter by <unk> who coined the term constant k for the campbell filter in order to distinguish them <stop>
<start> the great advantage campbell 's <unk> had over the <unk> circuit and other simple <unk> of the time was that they could be designed for any desired degree of stop band rejection or <unk> of transition between pass band and stop band it was only necessary to add more filter sections until the desired response was obtained <stop>
<start> the <unk> were designed by campbell for the purpose of separating <unk> telephone channels on transmission lines but their subsequent use has been much more widespread than that the design techniques used by campbell have largely been superseded however the ladder <unk> used by campbell with the constant k is still in use today with <unk> of modern filter designs such as the <unk> filter campbell gave constant k designs for low @-@ pass high @-@ pass and band @-@ pass <unk> band @-@ stop and multiple band <unk> are also possible <stop>
<start> some of the <unk> terms and section terms used in this article are pictured in the diagram below image theory defines quantities in terms of an infinite cascade of two @-@ port sections and in the case of the <unk> being discussed an infinite ladder network of l @-@ sections here l should not be confused with the <unk> l – in electronic filter <unk> l refers to the specific filter shape which resembles inverted letter l <stop>
<start> the sections of the hypothetical infinite filter are made of series elements having <unk> <unk> and <unk> elements with <unk> <unk> the factor of two is introduced for mathematical convenience since it is usual to work in terms of half @-@ sections where it disappears the image <unk> of the input and output port of a section will generally not be the same however for a mid @-@ series section that is a section from halfway through a series element to halfway through the next series element will have the same image <unk> on both ports due to symmetry this image <unk> is designated <unk> due to the t <unk> of a mid @-@ series section likewise the image <unk> of a mid @-@ <unk> section is designated <unk> due to the <unk> <unk> half of such a t or <unk> section is called a half @-@ section which is also an l @-@ section but with half the element values of the full l @-@ section the image <unk> of the half @-@ section is <unk> on the input and output ports on the side presenting the series element it is equal to the mid @-@ series <unk> but on the side presenting the <unk> element it is equal to the mid @-@ <unk> <unk> there are thus two variant ways of using a half @-@ section <stop>
<start> parts of this article or section rely on the reader 's knowledge of the complex <unk> representation of <unk> and <unk> and on knowledge of the frequency domain representation of signals <stop>
<start> the building block of constant k <unk> is the half @-@ section l network composed of a series <unk> z and a <unk> <unk> <unk> the k in constant k is the value given by <stop>
<start> <formula> <stop>
<start> thus k will have units of <unk> that is <unk> it is readily apparent that in order for k to be constant y must be the dual <unk> of z. a physical interpretation of k can be given by observing that k is the limiting value of <unk> as the size of the section in terms of values of its components such as <unk> <unk> etc approaches zero while keeping k at its initial value thus k is the characteristic <unk> <unk> of the transmission line that would be formed by these <unk> small sections it is also the image <unk> of the section at resonance in the case of band @-@ pass <unk> or at <unk> <num> in the case of low @-@ pass <unk> for example the pictured low @-@ pass half @-@ section has <stop>
<start> <formula> <stop>
<start> elements l and c can be made <unk> small while retaining the same value of k z and y however are both approaching zero and from the formulae below for image <unk> <stop>
<start> <formula> <stop>
<start> see also image <unk> <unk> <stop>
<start> the image <unk> of the section are given by <stop>
<start> <formula> <stop>
<start> and <stop>
<start> <formula> <stop>
<start> given that the filter does not contain any <unk> elements the image <unk> in the pass band of the filter is purely real and in the stop band it is purely imaginary for example for the pictured low @-@ pass half @-@ section <stop>
<start> <formula> <stop>
<start> the transition occurs at a cut @-@ off frequency given by <stop>
<start> <formula> <stop>
<start> below this frequency the image <unk> is real <stop>
<start> <formula> <stop>
<start> above the cut @-@ off frequency the image <unk> is imaginary <stop>
<start> <formula> <stop>
<start> the transmission parameters for a general constant k half @-@ section are given by <stop>
<start> <formula> <stop>
<start> and for a chain of n half @-@ sections <stop>
<start> <formula> <stop>
<start> for the low @-@ pass l @-@ shape section below the cut @-@ off frequency the transmission parameters are given by <stop>
<start> <formula> <stop>
<start> that is the transmission is <unk> in the pass @-@ band with only the phase of the signal changing above the cut @-@ off frequency the transmission parameters are <stop>
<start> <formula> <stop>
<start> the presented plots of image <unk> <unk> and phase change correspond to a low @-@ pass prototype filter section the prototype has a cut @-@ off frequency of <unk> <stop>
<start> <num> <unk> this is produced by a filter half @-@ section with <unk> l <stop>
<start> <num> <unk> this prototype can be <unk> scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values the low @-@ pass prototype can also be transformed into high @-@ pass band @-@ pass or band @-@ stop types by application of suitable frequency <unk> <stop>
<start> several l @-@ shape half @-@ sections may be <unk> to form a composite filter like <unk> must always face like in these combinations there are therefore two circuits that can be formed with two identical l @-@ shaped half @-@ sections where a port of image <unk> <unk> faces another <unk> the section is called a <unk> section where <unk> faces <unk> the section so formed is a t section further additions of half @-@ sections to either of these section forms a ladder network which may start and end with series or <unk> elements <stop>
<start> it should be borne in mind that the characteristics of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image <unk> this is usually not true of the sections at either end which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance the further the section is from the end of the filter the more accurate the prediction will become since the effects of the terminating <unk> are masked by the intervening sections <stop>
<start> the <unk> is an episode of the british science fiction television series doctor who first broadcast on christmas day <num> on bbc one it is the eighth christmas special since the show 's <num> revival and the first to be within a series it was written by head writer and executive producer steven moffat and directed by saul <unk> <stop>

<start> the episode saw several major design changes for the series the <unk> is the debut of a redesigned <unk> interior as well as a new title sequence and variation of the theme tune the new title sequence features a brief glimpse of the doctor 's face the first time since survival the final serial of the classic series in <num> that the doctor 's face has been seen in the title sequence moffat had noticed that the <unk> design was getting progressively whimsical and resembled more of a magical place rather than a machine it was designed by series production designer michael <unk> who stated that the new interior was also supposed to be darker and <unk> and provide an easier access to the gallery of the ship when shooting <stop>
<start> the doctor also wears a one @-@ off costume victorian @-@ themed which smith described as a bit <unk> <unk> meets the doctor moffat described the new outfit as a progression as the doctor was in a different phase of his life now and felt more grown @-@ up and <unk> the costume was designed by howard <unk> for this episode the <unk> also contains several references to sherlock holmes including the doctor dressing up as him moffat is co @-@ creator of the bbc series sherlock for which smith auditioned for the role of doctor watson before being cast as the doctor in addition the incidental music during the scene bears a resemblance to the sherlock theme <stop>
<start> this episode marks the return of jenna @-@ louise coleman who previously appeared in the series opener asylum of the <unk> coleman was cast because of her chemistry with matt smith and especially because she was able to talk faster than him she auditioned for the role of <unk> not <unk> from asylum as the concept of the two characters being the same only occurred to moffat whilst casting for <unk> the production team requested that the press and fans who attended advanced screenings keep coleman 's appearance a secret until asylum was broadcast the effort was ultimately successful moffat stated that the introduction of a new companion made the show feel different and brought the story to a new beginning with a different person meeting the doctor smith said that <unk> was different from her predecessor amy pond karen <unk> which allowed the audience to see a different side of the doctor coleman described her as resourceful and not intimidated citing the reason for following the doctor at the beginning as pursuing answers the <unk> who would become a travelling companion of the doctor would not debut until the spring premiere the bells of saint john save for a brief cameo at the end of the <unk> coleman stated that she played each version as individuals with trust that there would be a payoff to her mystery <stop>
<start> also returning to the series are neve <unk> as madame <unk> dan <unk> as <unk> and <unk> stewart as jenny all three previously appeared in a good man goes to war and reprised their roles both in this episode and in the <unk> they returned due to the popularity of <unk> and jenny moffat considered a spin @-@ off featuring them though he did not have the time to do it instead he decided to bring them back in the main series richard e. grant had previously played the doctor on two occasions as an alternative tenth doctor in the spoof charity special doctor who and the curse of <unk> death which was written by moffat and as an alternative <unk> doctor in the animated story scream of the <unk> which had been intended to be a continuation of the series before it was revived in <num> smith commented that grant was born to be a who villain he pitches it on that perfect level and tone grant 's appearance in doctor who was <unk> by the bbc via twitter announcing his appearance at midnight <num> august <num> tom ward was drawn to his role because of the quality of the script and also stated his young children were pleased that he appeared in the programme the great intelligence was voiced by sir ian <unk> the two children <unk> is governess to <unk> and <unk> were played by real @-@ life brother and sister joseph and ellie <unk> @-@ alden <stop>
<start> the <unk> was originally intended to be produced in the fourth production block of the series and be the first episode coleman shot as her character however it did not begin filming until the week of <num> august <num> after coleman had worked on later episodes while moffat was writing the christmas special the read @-@ through had taken place on <num> august <num> this was the first christmas special to be filmed in bbc wales new <unk> lock studios scenes featuring coleman and several guest stars in a victorian setting were filmed in newport wales while coleman and smith were also spotted filming in bristol two weeks later on <num> august some scenes which used snow props were filmed in portland square bristol where filming took place overnight on <num> – <num> august <num> bristol was chosen because it had victorian @-@ era architecture <unk> stated that his favourite set is the london street with the back of the pub which he said was based on a sixteenth @-@ century building in oxford the locations were blocked off and <unk> with fake snow <stop>
<start> the <unk> on the cloud was achieved through a mix of fog on the studio floor and post @-@ production special effects director saul <unk> explained that it was difficult to achieve the desired look for the <unk> the first ones he likened to <unk> from rainbow which was too cute of an appearance and so the effects team created more menacing cgi faces <unk> 's introduction to the <unk> introduced two novel effects for the show the first was a single @-@ shot camera tracking from a few feet away from the <unk> to its interior with the implication of the <unk> 's trans @-@ dimensional nature shown to the audience in the following shot the camera does a complete circle of the <unk> console an effect not seen since the early days of the show <unk> wanted to include this shot to further emphasize the bigger on the inside than the outside nature of the time machine <stop>
<start> in addition to the three prequel mini @-@ episodes the cast also filmed an additional promotional video <unk> <unk> which the bbc uploaded during the days leading up to the broadcast the video featured <unk> singing modified versions of several christmas songs in character as <unk> as his <unk> look on before everyone breaks character and begins laughing <stop>

<start> nick <unk> of <unk> gave the special four and a half out of five stars writing that the power of emotion saves the day again was appropriate in light of the festivities and many <unk> referenced in the story <unk> was positive towards the terrific comedy with <unk> coleman and the surprisingly <unk> grant as well as the new title sequence and <unk> while he wrote that the subtle <unk> of the great intelligence was a <unk> more interesting than the usual so we meet again <unk> he ultimately felt their threat never quite comes into sharp relief <unk> <unk> of the independent wrote that the <unk> was stronger than the previous year 's the doctor the widow and the <unk> as it was connected to the overall story of the series but still has a way to go if it is to live up to a christmas carol despite feeling that it was enjoyable she noted that the story feels truncated and rushed <stop>
<start> the mirror 's jon cooper also praised coleman and the new side of the doctor that was shown comparing it to rose tyler billie piper challenging the <unk> doctor christopher eccleston however he felt the character @-@ heavy story was to the <unk> of the plot which was a classic who set @-@ up that ultimately suffers from a lack of explanation and more set @-@ pieces than a coherent whole he felt that the episode may not have been accessible for casual viewers but offered much for fans in time for the programme 's fiftieth anniversary dominic <unk> of the daily telegraph gave the <unk> three out of five stars disappointed that it was not as scary as it had been <unk> to be while he was positive towards smith and the <unk> on the cloud he criticised <unk> and the <unk> @-@ like complexity of the script <stop>

<start> the light tank mk vii <unk> also known as the <unk> was a british light tank produced by vickers @-@ <unk> in the late 1930s and deployed during the world war ii the <unk> was originally designed as the latest in the line of light tanks built by the company for the british army it improved upon its predecessor the mk <unk> light tank by introducing the extra firepower of a <num> @-@ pounder gun the war office ordered <num> tanks an order that eventually increased to <num> production was delayed by several factors and as a consequence only <num> to <num> of the tanks were produced <stop>
<start> the tank 's design flaws combined with the decision by the war office not to use light tanks in british armoured divisions ruled out the use of <unk> in the north african campaign as a result the majority of the tanks remained in britain although <num> were sent to the ussr as part of the <unk> @-@ <unk> program in early <num> the royal armoured corps formed three squadrons for use in overseas amphibious operations one of which was equipped with <unk> in may <num> a small number of <unk> formed part of the british force which participated in the invasion of madagascar and in june <num> <unk> were attached to the 1st airborne division after it was decided that the design allowed its use as an air @-@ portable light tank to support british airborne forces the <unk> were transported and landed in specially designed general aircraft <unk> gliders a lack of gliders prevented their participation in the allied invasion of sicily in <num> instead they were attached to the new 6th airborne division and became part of the 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment <stop>
<start> the division used approximately <num> <unk> during the british airborne landings in normandy in june <num> the tanks were successfully landed by glider but they did not perform well several were lost in accidents and those that did see action proved to be inferior in firepower and armour to the armoured fighting vehicles of the german forces a few days after the beginning of the operation the tanks were removed from direct engagement with german armour and used only to provide fire support by august <num> most of the <unk> in action were replaced with cromwell cruiser tanks and the remainder were replaced by the <unk> <unk> in december <num> <stop>
<start> <unk> did not see any further combat and were deemed obsolete by <num> the last was retired in <num> there were several variations on the <unk> design including the <unk> self @-@ propelled gun and the light tank mk viii but none of these were ever used in active service with the british army <stop>
<start> the prototype of the light tank mk vii <unk> nicknamed <unk> was first developed in <num> by vickers @-@ <unk> as a private venture and was intended to be sold either to the british army or to foreign militaries it was to be the latest in a series of light tanks produced by the company the tank was designed to overcome the shortcomings of insufficient armament in earlier light tanks that were fitted only with machine guns vickers @-@ armstrong installed on the mk <unk> a <num> @-@ pounder <num> @-@ millimetre <num> @.@ <num> in main gun paired with a <num> @.@ <num> @-@ millimetre <num> @.@ <num> in <unk> machine gun and mounted the two guns in a two @-@ man turret the tank possessed a maximum of <num> millimetres <num> @.@ <num> in of armour the prototype weighed approximately <num> @,@ <num> pounds <num> @,@ <num> kg and was powered by a <num> @-@ horsepower <num> kw meadows engine <unk> was on eight road wheels four per side with no separate driver or <unk> wheels and it was capable of a <num> miles per hour <num> km h top speed the mk vii design relied on an unusual steering method and a mechanical system incorporated into earlier vickers models the front wheels could be steered to allow for gentle turns by <unk> the tracks for sharper turns the system returned to the conventional method of <unk> one track to turn the tank the dual system of turning was designed to lessen mechanical strain on the <unk> and reduce its power <unk> the suspension system was also a new design that relied on struts with pockets of air for <unk> and <unk> of oil for <unk> and each of the wheels was independently sprung <stop>
<start> the war office examined the design and put the prototype through a series of trials during may and june <num> the model was tested as a possible light cruiser since war office light tank needs were already met by its predecessor the mark vi the war office then took the view that the tank was not acceptable as a light cruiser because the <unk> <unk> offered better speed and obstacle crossing performance despite this it was decided that it was essential for some <unk> to be produced and it was suggested that they be brought in at the end of the light tank program accordingly the war office gave the <unk> the official general staff specification number <unk> and in november <num> accepted it for limited production after requesting a few minor changes which included the fitting of an external fuel tank to increase the tank 's range <stop>
<start> the number to be produced was subject to <unk> as the war office <unk> in their demand in july <num> it requested that <num> of the tanks be produced then increased the request to <num> after a three @-@ day conference in november production was to begin in july <num> but meanwhile the war office temporarily returned to its original order of <num> before increasing the number to <num> the number further increased to <num> after metropolitan <unk> carriage and <unk> a company part owned by vickers @-@ armstrong that would be producing the tanks indicated it had already ordered armour plating for that many tanks <stop>
<start> production of the tank was delayed by a number of factors the war office put their order on hold in a post @-@ battle of france decision to focus military production on infantry and cruiser tanks due to the poor performance of british light tanks during that battle due to the shortage of more suitable tanks light tanks that were not designed for use against german armour were nevertheless deployed against them the resulting high casualties led the war office to re @-@ evaluate the suitability of the light tank design the pre @-@ war role of the light tank that of reconnaissance meanwhile had been found to be better suited to scout cars that used smaller crews and had better cross @-@ country abilities further delays were caused by the bombing raids of the luftwaffe during may <num> against the factories where the tanks were assembled <stop>
<start> the cumulative effect of these delays resulted in the production of only a small number of mk <unk> estimates place the final total produced to be between <num> and <num> the name <unk> was given to the mk vii on <num> september <num> on the orders of the war office the last of the tanks were built in the first quarter of <num> and delivered at the end of the year <stop>
<start> the war office and the army were concluding at this point that light tanks were a liability and too vulnerable for use in further combat and the <unk> was considered to be obsolete this decision may have marked the end for the <unk> in active service several of the tanks destined to be deployed to the eighth army in the middle east for the north african campaign were left in britain when their cooling systems were determined to be unable to cope with the intense north african heat <stop>
<start> the demise of <unk> was prevented by a decision made by the war office in mid @-@ <num> as it was considering the equipment to be used by britain 's fledgling airborne forces formed in june <num> under the orders of the prime minister winston churchill when selecting the equipment for the airborne forces officials at the war office concluded that gliders would be an integral component gliders would transport troops and heavy equipment which by <num> was to include artillery and some form of tank plans to transport a tank went through a number of revisions but by may <num> the feasibility of a <num> @.@ <num> metric tons <num> @.@ <num> long tons tank to be carried for <num> miles <num> km in a glider was accepted although the aircraft would have to be specifically designed for the task in a conference held on <num> january <num> it was decided that the general aircraft <unk> currently under development would be used to transport a single <unk> tank or two universal <unk> the <unk> was chosen because it was an obsolete design and was therefore available to be used by the airborne forces <stop>
<start> beginning in january <num> training exercises were conducted carrying the <unk> and their crews inside <unk> gliders these exercises were successful during the training by c squadron of the <unk> pilot regiment which specialised in flying the <unk> over <num> @,@ <num> <unk> were made with an average of <num> <unk> per crew only three incidents resulted in fatalities or injuries with seven pilots killed during the training when the <unk> was re @-@ designated as an airborne tank several changes were made to its design a number of tanks had their <num> pounder guns replaced with a <num> @.@ <num> @-@ millimetre <num> @.@ <num> in infantry support howitzer these tanks were then designated as <unk> <num> <unk> close support additionally <unk> <unk> were added to those <unk> which still possessed their <num> pounders to increase their muzzle velocity and armour penetration <stop>
<start> the <unk> experienced several setbacks throughout its development and deployment with the army and airborne forces one of the major problems was the limited number of these tanks that existed after production ended in <num> which particularly affected the airborne forces the transport of <num> of the tanks to the ussr under the <unk> @-@ <unk> act depleted the number available for use by airborne forces as did the loss of several more during operation <unk> the invasion of madagascar a royal armoured corps report issued in december <num> stated that approximately <num> <unk> were available for use in a memorandum dated january <num> by major general george f. <unk> commander of the 1st airborne division <unk> complained that he had been informed that <num> of the tanks were available whereas only <num> actually remained with no reserves to replace those lost in combat this lack of sufficient replacement reserves combined with a war office report that some <unk> airborne tanks would be required for the 1st airborne division and an unnamed airborne division to be formed in india led to the <unk> 's eventual replacement by the us <unk> <unk> <stop>
<start> a number of design faults of the <unk> were revealed through its operational use its size limited the possible crew to three a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret resulting in too few crew members to operate the <unk> effectively the gunner or commander in addition to his own duties had to act as <unk> for the <num> pounder which caused delays in combat a report on the tank written in january <num> stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank controlling a troop of <unk> during combat would be almost impossible <stop>
<start> problems were also found with the <unk> <unk> fitted to the <num> @-@ pounder to increase its range and penetration power after they had been fitted the <unk> could not be removed and could only fire specially designed armour @-@ piercing rounds which took time to manufacture <stop>
<start> the war office also considered the <unk> 's cooling system faulty making the tank unsuitable for service in <unk> climates such as the middle east and north africa <stop>
<start> the first <unk> were delivered to the army in november <num> and were initially deployed with the 1st armoured division which was being refitted after losing the majority of its previous tanks during the battle of france and the newly formed 6th armoured division however the faults discovered with the <unk> cooling system precluded them from being integrated into units that were sent to the middle east to participate in the north african campaign shortly after all light tanks were discarded from the establishments of british armoured divisions as not suitable for further service <stop>
<start> the <unk> remained in britain and would probably have been used as training vehicles before being retired from service but on <num> june <num> the german invasion of the ussr operation barbarossa began and the ussr became an ally of britain the <unk> @-@ <unk> program begun in march <num> by the united states of america to supply defensive materials to britain and china was therefore extended to the ussr as part of the program the british government began supplying war materials to the ussr which in early <num> included a shipment of <num> <unk> as well as a number of valentine and matilda mk i infantry tanks the soviet military utilised a greater number of light tanks than the british and so could use the <unk> when the tanks arrived in the ussr however it was apparent that the design problems with the cooling system were also present in cold conditions additionally the cold weather had a <unk> effect on the tank 's suspension and tracks additional testing of the <unk> was conducted by the soviet military and the design was admired for its <unk> <unk> and speed as well its ability to run on low @-@ quality fuel unlike contemporary soviet designs the <unk> of the <unk> 's armour was found to be a problem and one which could not be solved as the weight of extra armour plating caused an unacceptable reduction in the tank 's speed despite these drawbacks in the <unk> 's design soviet authorities believed it to be comparable to the t @-@ <num> light tank in use at the time and decided that it was suitable to be used in combat a number of <unk> were sent to tank training schools which were subsequently sent into battle and in september <num> two were assigned to the <unk> <unk> tank battalion which was attached to the 5th guards tank brigade both tanks were destroyed in combat one on <num> september and the other on <num> october the latter a casualty of artillery fire several were also used for propaganda purposes appearing in photographs of soviet troops who were fighting in the <unk> region <stop>
<start> in mid @-@ <num> the royal armoured corps in britain created three tank squadrons for special overseas operations known as a b and c special service squadrons both a and b squadrons were equipped with valentine infantry tanks and mark <unk> light tanks but c squadron was equipped with twelve <unk> transferred from the 2nd armoured brigade 1st armoured division on <num> july <num> c squadron was officially activated and immediately received orders to prepare for overseas service alongside a and b squadrons in an unspecified tropical climate all three squadrons were transported to <unk> in scotland for intensive training that focused on embarkation and <unk> from ships and landing craft to prepare them for action in potential amphibious operations in early september elements of c squadron including six <unk> formed part of a force which sailed for freetown in west africa during this period of the war there were fears that the spanish government might enter the conflict on the side of germany and the force was <unk> to capture a number of spanish islands off the coast of africa if this occurred these fears proved <unk> and in march <num> the unit returned to britain to join the rest of the squadron in training <stop>
<start> the next assignment operation <unk> was the invasion of madagascar the third largest island in the world and then under <unk> french control the prime minister and the combined chiefs of staff decided that madagascar should be occupied as rapidly as possible to deny the port of <unk> to japanese naval forces which had recently advanced into the indian ocean operation <unk> was under the command of major general robert g. <unk> and consisted of no. <num> commando 29th independent brigade group and the 17th and 13th brigade groups from 5th infantry division the 29th brigade formed the core of the invasion force due to its training in amphibious operations and under its command was b special service squadron created by <unk> six <unk> from b squadron and six <unk> from c squadron into a single unit the squadron was formed into four troops one headquarters troop of three <unk> and one <unk> one of four <unk> and two formed from the remaining five <unk> the invasion force assembled off the west coast of the northern tip of madagascar on <num> may near <unk> and the bay of diego <unk> the invasion plan called for an amphibious assault landing on four beaches on the west side of the tip which would allow the british forces to advance approximately <num> miles <num> km and approach <unk> from the rear information about the landing beaches the defences possessed by the port and the <unk> french defending forces was limited and vague although it was believed that the defenders had no weapons capable of penetrating the armour of a valentine tank <stop>
<start> the landings began at <num> <num> on <num> may with <num> commando landing at <unk> bay and the three infantry brigades and b squadron landing at <unk> bay the objective of the infantry brigades and their armoured support was to take control of <unk> and a nearby town but although the infantry landed successfully b squadron had more trouble the area of beach designated for its landing craft was blocked for several hours after a <unk> came loose from a landing craft and became stuck in the sand the infantry brigades advanced toward <unk> without the squadron but eventually two <unk> and a single <unk> were dispatched in support catching up with the lead elements of the infantry near the town of <unk> here the invasion force encountered the first french defences consisting of camouflaged trenches and <unk> dug in along a ridge the tanks attempted to breach them but the rocky ground made <unk> difficult and they could not close with the <unk> and trenches they engaged a number of targets with <num> pounder and machine @-@ gun fire but the line had to be cleared by an infantry assault later in the day the tanks were ordered to outflank the defences and advance further into the island and they were soon joined by two other <unk> dispatched from the beaches the small force continued to advance until it encountered the <unk> french main line of defence this had been built prior to the first world war and included camouflaged <unk> machine @-@ gun nests and dug @-@ in <num> mm artillery pieces the latter although not specifically designed for an anti @-@ tank role could penetrate the armour of both the <unk> and the <unk> the two <unk> advanced first but were knocked out by artillery fire and two <unk> that were moving behind them suffered the same fate the third <unk> retreated in order to report on the french resistance machine <unk> a motorcycle combination and a truck it encountered on the way back <stop>
<start> the commander of the <unk> made his report and was then ordered to take command of four <unk> and two <unk> which had recently arrived and once again attempt to breach the french defences the tanks followed the road leading to the defensive line and then attempted to out @-@ flank the line by advancing from the right @-@ hand side using several hills as cover the artillery pieces were able to turn and face the assault however and one valentine and one <unk> were hit and destroyed the remaining tanks exchanged several <unk> of fire with the artillery pieces before retreating back to their original positions the french line was eventually broken by 29th brigade aided by an amphibious assault by royal marines the remaining tanks of b squadron two <unk> and three <unk> remained in defensive positions until the afternoon of <num> may coming under sporadic artillery fire which disabled another valentine the squadron played no further part in the battle as the <unk> french authorities negotiated a formal surrender the following day although french troops would continue to engage the british occupying force in guerrilla warfare until late november c squadron suffered heavy casualties during the invasion only one valentine and three <unk> out of twelve tanks were functional by <num> may and the squadron had suffered seven killed and six wounded it remained in madagascar until early <num> when it was shipped to india and took part in the burma campaign as part of 29th brigade <stop>
<start> because of a lack of equipment training facilities in mid @-@ <num> when the british airborne establishment was formed the war office was able to accept only <num> volunteers for training as airborne troops progress in setting up proper training facilities and acquiring suitable transport aircraft was so slow that the first british airborne operation operation <unk> was conducted by a <unk> commando unit by <num> there existed specifically trained airborne units including the 1st airborne division and on <num> january <num> the war office decided that a light tank unit would be one of the support units attached to the division this unit designated the light tank squadron was to be formed of nineteen light tanks and would operate to the fore of the division using their tanks speed to capture objectives and then holding them until relieved by other units the obvious unit for conversion was c special services squadron as it was trained to act as an independent tank unit and more importantly was the only unit that was still using <unk> it had been re @-@ designated as an airborne tank by the war office c squadron was officially transferred to the 1st airborne division on <num> june <num> bringing with it seven <unk> among its other vehicles the unit immediately began training but was not attached to the 1st airborne division for long during mid @-@ <num> the division was transported to the middle east so it could participate in the allied invasion of sicily c squadron remained in britain as not enough <unk> gliders had been built by the time the division departed to transport its <unk> the squadron was transferred to the 6th airborne division which had been raised in april <num> and c squadron remained with it for the rest of the conflict the squadron continued to train as an air @-@ portable unit and participated in a number of exercises to prepare for its new duties including reconnaissance of enemy positions and counter @-@ attacking enemy infantry and armour <stop>
<start> on <num> december <num> the war office decided to expand the squadron into a regiment equipped with a combination of light tanks and conventional reconnaissance vehicles such as scout cars and on <num> april <num> it was re @-@ designated as the 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment the regiment consisted of a headquarters squadron a light tank squadron and a reconnaissance squadron two <unk> the mark <num> <unk> variation were attached to the headquarters squadron but the light tank squadron also known as a squadron received the majority of the <unk> a squadron had approximately nineteen <unk> split between six troops two of which were of the <unk> variation and the rest were armed with <num> pounders fitted with <unk> <unk> on <num> may <num> after participating in a further series of exercises and manoeuvres a squadron moved from their training area to a transit camp at <unk> <unk> airfield while the rest of the regiment moved to raf <unk> norton airfield the next day from these two airfields the regiment would be transported from to participate in the british airborne landings in normandy the operation began on the night of <num> june with the deployment of 6th airborne division to eastern normandy it was tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the allied <unk> landings securing strategically important areas east of caen capturing several important bridges over the caen canal and river <unk> and destroying a coastal artillery battery <unk> transport aircraft were available to land all three of the division 's brigades simultaneously one would have to be landed in a second lift later in the day major general richard gale had initially intended for the 6th <unk> brigade to which the 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment was attached to be landed first however aerial photography revealed that anti @-@ glider poles had been erected in the landing zone selected for the brigade therefore gale decided that the 3rd parachute brigade and 5th parachute brigade which did not <unk> gliders should land in the first lift to clear the landing zones allowing the 6th <unk> brigade to land in the second lift <stop>
<start> the <unk> and <unk> gliders of the brigade landed at <num> <num> on <num> june in a landing zone cleared of obstructions by the 5th parachute brigade the primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division the 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance squadron was to aid in the latter task acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out german positions and impede the movement of german forces attempting to counter @-@ attack the <unk> of a squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed but the squadron 's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in normandy it lost one tank before the formation landed when the <unk> broke loose of its <unk> and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it causing both to fall into the sea mid @-@ flight the squadron 's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone destroying themselves and the <unk> they carried a third <unk> hit another <unk> as it was being <unk> and flipped the tank upside down rendering it unusable although the crew escaped without injury the surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their <unk> forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding <unk> <stop>
<start> the squadron retrieved all of the remaining <unk> and advanced to the south of the landing zone to link up with the rest of the regiment there they received orders to support the 8th parachute battalion in the <unk> de <unk> area and conduct reconnaissance duties after linking with the battalion the squadron began <unk> and engaged german infantry and armour they encountered by the end of <num> june two <unk> had been lost to enemy action one destroyed by a german self @-@ propelled gun and the second by hitting a mine the division was reinforced by british troops who were advancing from the invasion beaches and it began to push through normandy while the squadron continued its reconnaissance duties at this time gale decided to avoid when possible engaging the <unk> with german armour as they proved to be completely <unk> by the german tanks and self @-@ propelled guns such as the panzer iv and the <unk> iii instead when the division required armoured support it summoned it from armoured units outside the division and the <unk> were used to support infantry patrols and provide fire support by august in the division 's preparation for the planned breakout from the normandy bridgehead the majority of <unk> in a squadron were replaced with cromwell fast cruiser tanks only three <unk> remained assigned to the headquarters troop of a squadron <stop>
<start> operation tonga was the last that <unk> saw of active combat during the first week of october <num> the 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment underwent an extensive <unk> in which it was completely <unk> and all the remaining <unk> were retired they were replaced with the <unk> <unk> a purpose @-@ built airborne light tank of american design eight <unk> were used by the regiment in march <num> during operation <unk> the airborne operation to cross the river rhine a report issued by the director air of the war office in january <num> confirmed that the <unk> design was considered obsolete and any light tanks used in post @-@ war airborne formations would be entirely new in design a small number of <unk> remained in service with the 3rd hussars until <num> a <unk> glider flight was stationed at raf <unk> and a troop of <unk> was kept by the regiment for training exercises with the gliders however glider training by the regiment was stopped in <num> and the <unk> withdrawn from service <stop>
<start> there were several variants of the <unk> design the first was the light tank mk viii vickers @-@ armstrong 's proposed successor to the <unk> the mark viii was also known as the harry hopkins named after president roosevelt 's chief diplomatic advisor and was given the general staff design number <unk> by the war office the mark viii was intended to improve upon the design of the <unk> in a number of areas it had thicker armour than the <unk> with the front hull and turret armour increased to a thickness of <num> millimetres <num> @.@ <num> in and the side armour to <num> millimetres <num> @.@ <num> in and the turret and hull given more sloped surfaces to help <unk> shells fired at the tank the dimensions of the <unk> were also changed the mark viii was longer by <num> inches <num> @.@ <num> m wider by <num> foot <num> inches <num> @.@ <num> m and heavier the new tank was no longer air @-@ portable as it was too heavy to be carried by a <unk> the <num> @-@ cylinder engine of the <unk> was fitted to the mark viii although the increased weight meant that its maximum speed decreased to <num> miles per hour <num> km h its armament also remained the same as that of the <unk> the war office authorised the construction of three prototype models in april <num> the new design was considered a success and the tank board of the war office ordered <num> @,@ <num> to be constructed in september however problems were encountered with further tests of the prototypes and a report issued in december <num> stated that production of the mark viii had been delayed due to developmental problems these problems continued to persist into <num> when the war office decided against using the tank in active service approximately <num> mark <unk> were produced by <num> when production ended <stop>
<start> a second variant on the <unk> design was the <unk> <unk> drive <unk> dd the <unk> drive system was invented by nicholas <unk> and was designed to allow a tank to swim through water and participate in amphibious operations the system functioned by <unk> a large <unk> canvas screen around the tank above its tracks which was supported by thirty @-@ six <unk> tubes and steel struts this gave the tank sufficient <unk> to float and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank 's engine the screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land the system was fitted during june <num> as the <unk> was the lightest light tank available at the time the converted tank was successfully tested on a number of lakes and reservoirs allowing the <unk> drive system to be tested on heavier tanks such as the valentine the system would be used during operation <unk> when m4 sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches <stop>

<start> <unk> was released to mostly positive reviews from video game journalists the game was universally lauded for its graphics with magazines like sega pro describing them as some of the best graphics around the game was also praised for its music and puzzles as well as their clever use in the game however <unk> was criticized for its controls being described by ign as float @-@ y and making certain segments of the game <unk> difficult the game was also criticized for its lack of difficulty overall as well as its lack of speech samples which several other genesis games of the time had <stop>
<start> the player as donald ventures through a variety of side @-@ scrolling levels generally each level is divided into an overland part and a dungeon such as the <unk> 's palace or the temple in which the great duck treasure resides although the player may choose any order to play the overland sections various obstacles prevent the player from entering the <unk> outside of a specific order in addition to this some levels provide the player with vital clues which solve puzzles needed to progress in later sections once donald has completed the overland section of an area he may leave by calling his nephews biplane and will return to the dungeon entrance of that area if the player chooses to return <stop>
<start> donald is armed with a special gun that can shoot <unk> popcorn or bubble gum donald has unlimited <unk> which can only temporarily <unk> enemies though bosses can still be damaged with <unk> and can collect popcorn and gum along the way or get the latter from <unk> <unk> later in the game the <unk> is upgraded to act as a temporary platform to climb walls with and when stuck to a passing bird allows donald to traverse longer distances in <unk> india and egypt donald can also pick up <unk> <unk> which increase his temper eventually temporarily allowing him to become <unk> increase his speed and knock out enemies in his path <stop>
<start> while donald is <unk> through some books in <unk> <unk> 's library a map falls out of a book relating to the treasure of king <unk> ruler of the great duck kingdom in ancient times the map leads to the location of the king 's most prized possession hidden in a secret place shortly before his death donald thinks this is his path to riches unfortunately big bad pete <unk> and pursues donald throughout the game hoping to steal the treasure <stop>
<start> <unk> with his nephews huey <unk> and <unk> and using the partial map from the library donald begins his search in <unk> with the trail being directed to an aztec pyramid in mexico outside the pyramid he is directed by a sweet <unk> to obtain a hero key from an explorer back in <unk> to open the pyramid inside the pyramid donald meets <unk> who gives him a strange note and a <unk> to help him reach higher places and tells him that <unk> <unk> is looking for him back in <unk> travelling across the <unk> of <unk> to meet <unk> donald is given <unk> 's latest invention <unk> <unk> that can break through walls the last location on the partial map is count <unk> 's castle in transylvania where donald encounters a ghost who tells him that the count carries the real treasure map <stop>
<start> after defeating <unk> donald receives a more complete map in india donald enters the palace of the <unk> where she challenges him to defeat the tiger in her garden in exchange for a <unk> <unk> donald succeeds and receives the <unk> <unk> which is the key to open a temple in egypt donald is able to solve the <unk> of the <unk> using the note <unk> had given him and obtains the <unk> of ra before escaping in a mine cart from there he journeys to the south pole where he finds a key frozen in ice and uses the <unk> of ra to melt the ice and grab the key the key unlocks the hold of a viking ship which contains an ancient diary with the secret to locating the treasure the ship is haunted by ghosts and the viking captain sends donald below decks to get rid of them after defeating a skeletal viking warrior donald returns to the deck where the captain informs him that the diary is hidden in ice near the south pole and gives him an ancient viking <unk> that <unk> to flying creatures donald then returns to the south pole <unk> a ride on one of pete 's bird <unk> to reach the diary <stop>
<start> however upon finding the diary pete shows up holding donald 's nephews hostage in exchange for the diary after giving pete the diary donald travels to pete 's hideout to defeat pete and get the diary back the diary reveals that the map when dipped in water will reveal the location of the great duck treasure donald flies to the island where the treasure is hidden and manages to evade its traps in order to reach the treasure vault after defeating the ancient spirit guarding the treasure donald opens the vault only to find a simple stone statue when the disappointed donald returns home huey <unk> and <unk> accidentally break the statue which reveals a golden <unk> necklace was hidden inside donald gives the necklace to daisy and the two fly off into the sunset together <stop>

<start> <unk> received a mostly positive response from critics upon release gamerankings an aggregator for video game reviews assigned the game a score of <num> based on <num> reviews mega placed the game at <num> in their top mega drive games of all time list <unk> magazine praised the game 's graphics but criticized the game 's easy difficulty level explaining simply that the graphics are excellent but the game is easy to complete damian <unk> from sega pro also praised the graphics stating that the game has without a doubt some of the best graphics around and that the sprites and backgrounds are consistently excellent he also noted the game 's various puzzles and their use in the game explaining that e <unk> if the ideas are not original the way they are strung together to accelerate the pace to <unk> is nothing short of breath @-@ taking levi buchanan from ign gave <unk> a <num> @.@ <num> <num> also lauding the graphics and animation as excellent and saying the music was pleasing <stop>
<start> <unk> criticized donald 's controls in certain situations in the game as well as the difficulty of some levels and puzzles buchanan also criticized the controls calling them float @-@ y and noted the difficulty in executing precision jumps explaining that i t 's far too easy to <unk> or under @-@ shoot a narrow column and slip to your <unk> <unk> was also dubious of the number of credits stating that the game may seem easy with unlimited continues but that the player will still need considerable skill to reach the treasure island buchanan was disappointed with the lack of speech samples explaining that it 's a bit of a drag with a character that is so defined by his voice ultimately <unk> said that y <unk> players will instantly be <unk> by donald 's quest and that <unk> is everything a cartoon game should be and more buchanan summed up the game as being a good platformer <unk> up by some questionable controls and recommended the game as a <unk> enjoyable <num> @-@ bit platformer that would fit nicely in your genesis collection <stop>
<start> the <unk> colossal heads are at least seventeen monumental stone representations of human heads sculpted from large basalt boulders the heads date from at least before <num> bc and are a distinctive feature of the <unk> civilization of ancient <unk> all portray mature men with <unk> <unk> flat <unk> and slightly crossed eyes their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is still common among the inhabitants of <unk> and veracruz the backs of the monuments often are flat the boulders were brought from the sierra de los <unk> mountains of veracruz given that the extremely large slabs of stone used in their production were transported over large distances requiring a great deal of human effort and resources it is thought that the monuments represent portraits of powerful individual <unk> rulers each of the known examples has a distinctive headdress the heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major <unk> centres but the method and logistics used to transport the stone to these sites remain unclear <stop>
<start> the discovery of a colossal head at <unk> <unk> in the nineteenth century spurred the first archaeological investigations of <unk> culture by matthew <unk> in <num> seventeen confirmed examples are known from four sites within the <unk> <unk> on the gulf coast of mexico most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from san lorenzo <unk> were re @-@ carved from massive stone <unk> an additional monument at <unk> <unk> in guatemala is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head this is the only known example from outside the <unk> <unk> <stop>
<start> <unk> the monuments remains difficult because of the movement of many from their original contexts prior to archaeological investigation most have been dated to the early <unk> period <num> – <num> bc with some to the middle <unk> <num> – <num> bc period the smallest weigh <num> tons while the largest is variously estimated to weigh <num> to <num> tons although it was abandoned and left unfinished close to the source of its stone <stop>
<start> the <unk> civilization developed in the lowlands of southeastern mexico between <num> and <num> bc the <unk> <unk> lies on the gulf coast of mexico within the states of veracruz and <unk> an area measuring approximately <num> kilometres <num> mi east to west and extending about <num> kilometres <num> mi inland from the coast the <unk> are regarded as the first civilization to develop in <unk> and the <unk> <unk> is one of six <unk> of civilization worldwide the others being the <unk> <unk> culture of south america the <unk> culture of china 's yellow river the indus valley civilization of south asia the civilization of ancient egypt and the <unk> civilization of ancient iraq of these only the <unk> civilization developed in a lowland tropical forest setting <stop>
<start> the <unk> were the first inhabitants of the americas to construct monumental architecture and to settle in towns and cities they were also the first people in the americas to develop a sophisticated style of stone sculpture in the first decade of the 21st century evidence emerged of <unk> writing with the earliest examples of <unk> hieroglyphs dating to around <num> bc examples of script have been found on roller stamps and stone artefacts the texts are short and have been partially <unk> based on their similarity to other <unk> scripts the evidence of complex society developing in the <unk> <unk> has led to the <unk> being regarded as the mother culture of <unk> although this concept remains controversial <stop>
<start> some of the <unk> rulers seem to have served religious functions the city of san lorenzo was succeeded as the main centre of the civilization by la <unk> in about <num> bc with <unk> <unk> and <unk> de los <unk> possibly sharing the role other urban centres were much less significant the nature and degree of the control exercised by the centres over a widespread rural population remains unclear very fine <unk> art much clearly made for an elite survives in several forms notably <unk> figurines and larger sculptures such as the <unk> the figurines have been recovered in large numbers and are mostly in pottery these were presumably widely available to the population together with these of particular relevance to the colossal heads are the <unk> @-@ style masks in stone so called because none have yet been excavated in circumstances that allow the proper archaeological identification of an <unk> context these evocative stone face masks present both similarities and differences to the colossal heads two thirds of <unk> monumental sculpture represents the human form and the colossal heads fall within this major theme of <unk> art <stop>
<start> the colossal heads cannot be precisely dated however the san lorenzo heads were buried by <num> bc indicating that their period of manufacture and use was earlier still the heads from <unk> <unk> had been moved from their original context before they were investigated by archaeologists and the heads from la <unk> were found partially exposed on the modern ground surface the period of production of the colossal heads is therefore unknown as is whether it spanned a century or a millennium estimates of the time span during which colossal heads were produced vary from <num> to <num> years the san lorenzo heads are believed to be the oldest and are the most <unk> executed all of the stone heads have been assigned to the <unk> period of <unk> chronology generally to the early <unk> <num> – <num> bc although the two <unk> <unk> heads and the la <unk> head are attributed to the middle <unk> <num> – <num> bc <stop>
<start> <unk> colossal heads vary in height from <num> @.@ <num> to <num> @.@ <num> metres <num> @.@ <num> to <num> @.@ <num> ft and weigh between <num> and <num> tons all of the <unk> colossal heads depict mature men with flat <unk> and <unk> <unk> the eyes tend to be slightly crossed the general physical characteristics of the heads are of a type that is still common among people in the <unk> region in modern times the backs of the heads are often flat as if the monuments were originally placed against a wall all examples of <unk> colossal heads wear distinctive <unk> that probably represent cloth or animal hide originals some examples have a tied knot at the back of the head and some are decorated with feathers a head from la <unk> is decorated with the head of a bird there are similarities between the <unk> on some of the heads that has led to speculation that specific <unk> may represent different dynasties or perhaps identify specific rulers most of the heads wear large <unk> inserted into the ear lobes <stop>
<start> all of the heads are realistic <unk> and <unk> descriptions of the men it is likely that they were portraits of living or recently deceased rulers well known to the <unk> each head is distinct and <unk> displaying <unk> features they were once thought to represent <unk> although this theory is no longer widely held it is possible however that they represent rulers equipped for the <unk> <unk> <unk> expressions depicted on the heads vary from stern through placid to smiling the most <unk> <unk> art is the earliest appearing suddenly without surviving <unk> with a tendency towards more stylised sculpture as time progressed some surviving examples of wooden sculpture recovered from el <unk> demonstrate that the <unk> are likely to have created many more <unk> sculptures than works sculpted from stone <stop>
<start> in the late nineteenth century josé <unk> y serrano described a colossal head as having ethiopian features and speculations that the <unk> had african origins resurfaced in <num> in the work of alfonso <unk> <unk> and in the 1970s in the writings of ivan van <unk> such speculation is not taken seriously by <unk> scholars such as richard <unk> and ann <unk> <stop>
<start> although all the colossal heads are broadly similar there are distinct stylistic differences in their execution one of the heads from san lorenzo bears traces of plaster and red paint suggesting that the heads were originally brightly decorated heads did not just represent individual <unk> rulers they also incorporated the very concept of rulership itself <stop>
<start> the production of each colossal head must have been carefully planned given the effort required to ensure the necessary resources were available it seems likely that only the more powerful <unk> rulers were able to <unk> such resources the workforce would have included <unk> labourers <unk> <unk> <unk> and other <unk> producing the tools to make and move the monument in addition to the support needed to feed and otherwise attend to these workers the seasonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the production of the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end <stop>
<start> archaeological investigation of <unk> basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away both large and small <unk> of stone the sculpture was then refined by <unk> the surface using <unk> which were generally rounded <unk> that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself although this was not always the case <unk> were found in association with workshops at san lorenzo indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail <unk> colossal heads were fashioned as in @-@ the @-@ round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the <unk> and <unk> monument <num> at san lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned it is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re @-@ carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed <stop>
<start> all seventeen of the confirmed heads in the <unk> <unk> were sculpted from basalt mined in the sierra de los <unk> mountains of veracruz most were formed from coarse <unk> dark grey basalt known as <unk> <unk> basalt after a volcano in the range <unk> have proposed that large <unk> <unk> basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains are the source of the stone for the monuments these boulders are found in an area affected by large <unk> volcanic mudslides that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes which suggests that the <unk> did not need to quarry the raw material for <unk> the heads roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head the stone for the san lorenzo and la <unk> heads was transported a considerable distance from the source the la <unk> head was found on el <unk> hill in the sierra de los <unk> and the stone from <unk> <unk> <unk> head <num> and <unk> <unk> head <num> also known as <unk> <unk> monuments a and q came from the same hill <stop>
<start> the boulders were transported over <num> kilometres <num> mi from the source of the stone the exact method of transportation of such large masses of rock are unknown especially since the <unk> lacked <unk> of burden and functional wheels and they were likely to have used water transport whenever possible coastal currents of the gulf of mexico and in river estuaries might have made the <unk> transport of monuments weighing <num> tons or more impractical two badly damaged <unk> sculptures depict rectangular stone blocks bound with ropes a largely destroyed human figure rides upon each block with their legs hanging over the side these sculptures may well depict <unk> rulers overseeing the transport of the stone that would be fashioned into their monuments when transport over land was necessary the <unk> are likely to have used <unk> ramps and roads to facilitate moving the heads the regional terrain offers significant obstacles such as swamps and floodplains avoiding these would have necessitated crossing undulating hill country the construction of temporary <unk> using the suitable and plentiful floodplain soils would have allowed a direct route across the floodplains to the san lorenzo plateau earth structures such as mounds platforms and <unk> upon the plateau demonstrate that the <unk> possessed the necessary knowledge and could commit the resources to build large @-@ scale earthworks <stop>
<start> the flat backs of many of the colossal heads represented the flat bases of the monumental <unk> from which they were reworked only four of the seventeen <unk> heads do not have flattened backs indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments alternatively the backs of many of these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport providing a stable form for <unk> the monuments with ropes two heads from san lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental <unk> <unk> and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments <stop>

<start> according to stevens in one of his first games as head coach he was nervous and felt like our team played on edge because of it he decided that a team 's play will reflect the mood of its coach a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in difficult game situations while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge i don ’ t want to lose a game because of my approach he told himself accordingly he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games he rarely raises his voice or gets emotional instead quietly observing on the <unk> with folded arms he does not get upset about bad calls by <unk> or player mistakes preferring to focus on the next play rather than what just happened butler player willie <unk> explained butler 's <num> final four run by saying when those big runs by syracuse and kansas state came coach called a timeout and said a few calm words then he said he believes in us he loves us and we 're going to win the game on the rare occasion stevens feels the need to correct a player he does it with positive reinforcement just at a little louder <unk> according to former assistant coach matthew graves above all stevens wants his players to be confident not living in fear of being <unk> for making a bad play <stop>
<start> <unk> stevens is always calm but internally he is far from it i 'm not as calm as everybody thinks stevens says his wife tracy adds he ’ s calm and collected but he ’ s fiercely competitive he ’ s always thinking about how he can beat you former player joel <unk> says everyone sees brad as a level @-@ headed calm and cool coach but he ’ s about as competitive of a guy as i know we would get into it constantly whether playing two @-@ on @-@ two or arguing about players ’ having better college careers <stop>
<start> stevens spends a lot of time preparing for each game and always tries to add a few new <unk> specific to that game 's opponent sports illustrated calls stevens an expert on breaking down tape and looking at statistical trends to find opponents weaknesses former player ronald <unk> agrees we know everything we need to about our opponents all their tendencies are broken down ahead of time <stop>
<start> stevens is a proponent of using statistical analysis to enhance his coaching decisions spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film i think it 's a unique way of looking at the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players he explains for example when butler was <unk> in late <num> stevens challenged his team this <num> defensive field goal percentage is where we are this isn 't acceptable to get to where we want to go but what does that really mean it 's not just get better <unk> it is if we give up <num> less <unk> a game then we will be at <num> percent field goal percentage defense which will be top <num> in the country the team got the message improved throughout the season and ultimately went on a march run fueled by defense in <num> stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added drew cannon to the staff if he had the resources stevens says he would hire a team of <unk> to analyze the teams play <stop>
<start> stevens teams are built around solid basketball <unk> and good team work rather than individual basketball skill his teams are known for their defense forcing opponents into <unk> mistakes the secret to basketball – and life – is just to do the job to the best of your ability and don 't worry about anything else stevens says <unk> the next game <unk> the next possession that 's our focus it 's boring it 's also the way championships are won he says in short stevens is a strong believer in the butler way – doing all the little things that transform a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team i tell the players the butler way isn 't easy to define stevens says but you can see it on the floor when we share the basketball play with great energy and defend <stop>
<start> stevens prefers to recruit strong team players instead of going after top recruits the guys we have recruited most of them weren 't very highly ranked stevens says they had very good high school careers or careers at other places transfers but for one reason or the other they weren 't seen as great players but they all had <unk> stevens puts a strong emphasis on education and has said he would only recruit a one and done player if he was committed to getting his degree while playing professionally <stop>
<start> stevens has often been referred to as a coaching <unk> but is not interested in self @-@ promotion he instead prefers to <unk> the praise he receives to the players athletic department and his <unk> he has not been known to posture for more money or to leak his name for open coaching positions he has been described as humble modest and not about the money <stop>
<start> the new york times usa today espn and other commentators have attributed butler 's success against teams with superior athletes to stevens coaching style the times remarks the bulldogs are very well prepared for their opponents and they do not <unk> easily and says that the resulting confidence has led to the team 's success he coaches to his personality and to his strengths <unk> says <unk> he has great <unk> and communication ability with his team yahoo sports compared stevens to legendary coach john wooden writing brad stevens is winning at butler the wooden way – calm and composed on the <unk> wooden agreed saying i enjoy watching stevens and very much enjoy butler 's style of play <stop>

<start> <unk> is an impact crater that lies at the south pole of the moon the peaks along the crater 's rim are exposed to almost continual sunlight while the interior is <unk> in shadow a <unk> of eternal darkness the low @-@ temperature interior of this crater functions as a cold trap that may capture and freeze <unk> shed during comet impacts on the moon measurements by the <unk> <unk> spacecraft showed higher than normal amounts of hydrogen within the crater which may indicate the presence of water ice the crater is named after antarctic explorer ernest <unk> <stop>
<start> the rotational axis of the moon lies within <unk> only a few kilometers from its center the crater is <num> km in diameter and <num> @.@ <num> km deep from the earth it is viewed edge @-@ on in a region of rough <unk> terrain it is located within the south pole @-@ <unk> basin on a <unk> the rim is slightly raised about the surrounding surface and it has an outer rampart that has been only lightly impacted no significant craters intersect the rim and it is sloped about <num> @.@ <num> ° toward the direction <num> – <num> ° from the earth the age of the crater is about <num> @.@ <num> billion years and it has been in the proximity of the south lunar pole for at least the last two billion years <stop>
<start> because the orbit of the moon is <unk> only <num> ° from the ecliptic the interior of this crater lies in perpetual darkness estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from earth @-@ based radar studies <unk> along the rim of the crater are almost continually illuminated by sunlight spending about <num> – <num> of each lunar orbit exposed to the sun <unk> illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the 1900s <stop>
<start> the shadowed portion of the crater was <unk> with the <unk> camera of the japanese <unk> spacecraft using the illumination of sunlight reflected off the rim the interior of the crater consists of a symmetrical <num> ° slope that leads down to a <num> @.@ <num> km diameter floor the handful of craters along the interior span no more than a few hundred meters the bottom is covered by an uneven mound @-@ like feature that is <num> to <num> m thick the central peak is about <num> m in height <stop>
<start> the continuous shadows in the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperature that never exceeds about <num> k. for <unk> the average temperature was determined to be about <num> k reaching <num> k at the crater floor under these conditions the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be <num> − <num> to <num> − <num> m s any water vapor that arrives here following a <unk> impact on the moon would lie permanently frozen on or below the surface however the surface albedo of the crater floor matches the lunar far @-@ side suggesting that there is no exposed surface ice <stop>
<start> this crater was named after ernest henry <unk> an anglo @-@ irish explorer of antarctica from <num> until his death in <num> the name was officially adopted by the international astronomical union in <num> nearby craters of note include shoemaker <unk> de <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> farther away on the eastern hemisphere of the lunar near side are the larger craters <unk> and scott named after two other early explorers of the antarctic continent <stop>
<start> from the perspective of the earth this crater lies along the southern limb of the moon making observation difficult detailed mapping of the polar regions and <unk> of the moon did not occur until the advent of orbiting spacecraft <unk> lies entirely within the rim of the immense south pole @-@ <unk> basin which is one of the largest known impact formations in the solar system this basin is over <num> kilometers deep and an exploration of its properties could provide useful information about the lunar interior <stop>
<start> a neutron <unk> on board the <unk> <unk> spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to the northern and southern lunar poles including the crater <unk> at the end of this mission in july <num> the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater shoemaker in the hope of detecting from earth @-@ based telescopes an impact @-@ generated plume containing water vapor the impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals or that the impact site did not contain any ice alternatively it is possible that the crash did not excavate deeply enough into the <unk> to liberate significant quantities of water vapor <stop>
<start> from earth @-@ based radar and spacecraft images of the crater edge <unk> appears to be relatively intact much like a young crater that has not been significantly eroded from subsequent impacts this may mean that the inner sides are relatively steep which may make traversing the sides relatively difficult for a robotic vehicle in addition it is possible that the interior floor might not have collected a significant quantity of <unk> since its formation however other craters in the vicinity are considerably older and may contain significant deposits of hydrogen possibly in the form of water ice see shoemaker lunar crater for example <stop>
<start> radar studies preceding and following the <unk> <unk> mission demonstrate that the inner walls of <unk> are similar in reflective characteristics to those of some <unk> craters in particular the surroundings appear to contain a significant number of blocks in its <unk> blanket suggesting that its radar properties are a result of surface <unk> and not ice deposits as was previously suggested from a radar experiment involving the <unk> mission this interpretation however is not universally agreed upon within the scientific community radar images of the crater at a wavelength of <num> cm show no evidence for water ice deposits <stop>
<start> optical imaging inside the crater was done for the first time by the japanese lunar <unk> spacecraft <unk> in <num> it did not have any evidence of significant amount of water ice down to the image resolution of <num> m per pixel <stop>
<start> on november <num> <num> a <num> @-@ kg probe made a hard landing near the crater the moon impact probe <unk> was launched from the indian <unk> @-@ i spacecraft and reached the surface <num> minutes later the probe carried a radar <unk> video imaging system and a mass <unk> which will be used to search for water <stop>
<start> some sites along <unk> 's rim receive almost constant illumination at these <unk> sunlight is almost always available for conversion into electricity using solar panels potentially making them good locations for future moon landings the temperature at this site is also more favorable than at more equatorial latitudes as it does not experience the daily temperature extremes of <num> ° c when the sun is overhead to as low as − <num> ° c during the lunar night <stop>
<start> while scientific experiments performed by <unk> and <unk> <unk> could indicate the presence of water in the polar craters the current evidence is far from definitive there are doubts among scientists as to whether or not the hydrogen is in the form of ice as well as to the concentration of this ore with depth below the surface resolution of this issue will require future missions to the moon the presence of water suggests that the crater floor could potentially be mined for deposits of hydrogen in water form a commodity that is expensive to deliver directly from the earth <stop>
<start> this crater has also been proposed as a future site for a large infrared telescope the low temperature of the crater floor makes it ideal for infrared observations and solar cells placed along the rim could provide near @-@ continuous power to the observatory about <num> kilometers from the crater lies the <num> @-@ km tall <unk> mountain a peak that is <unk> visible from the earth and which could serve as a radio relay station when suitably equipped <stop>
<start> nasa has named the rim of <unk> as a potential candidate for its lunar outpost slated to be up and running by <unk> and continuously staffed by a crew by <unk> the location would promote self @-@ <unk> for lunar residents as perpetual sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for solar panels furthermore the shadowed polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary for human consumption and could also be harvested for fuel manufacture <stop>

<start> scholars and academics have offered many possible readings of american beauty film critics are similarly divided not so much about the quality of the film as their interpretations of it described by many as about the meaning of life or the hollow existence of the american suburbs the film has defied categorization by even the filmmakers <unk> is <unk> saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it a mystery story a <unk> journey through american <unk> a series of love stories ... it was about imprisonment ... loneliness and beauty it was funny it was angry sad the literary critic and author wayne c. <unk> concludes that the film <unk> any one interpretation american beauty cannot be adequately summarized as here is a satire on what 's wrong with american life that plays down the celebration of beauty it is more tempting to <unk> it as a portrait of the beauty underlying american <unk> and <unk> but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror and ball 's disgust with our <unk> it cannot be summarized with either lester or ricky 's philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live he argues that the problem of interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its center — a controlling voice who <unk> all of the choices he contends that in american beauty 's case it is neither <unk> nor ball <unk> considers the voice to be ball 's but even while the writer was strongly influential on set he often had to accept deviations from his vision particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic with <unk> voices <unk> on the original author 's <unk> says those who interpret american beauty have forgotten to probe for the elusive center according to <unk> the film 's true controller is the creative energy that hundreds of people put into its production agreeing and <unk> inserting and cutting <stop>
<start> <unk> called american beauty a rite of passage film about imprisonment and escape from imprisonment the <unk> of lester 's existence is established through his gray <unk> workplace and <unk> clothing in these scenes he is often framed as if trapped reiterating rituals that hardly please him he <unk> in the <unk> of his shower the shower stall evokes a jail cell and the shot is the first of many where lester is confined behind bars or within frames such as when he is reflected behind columns of numbers on a computer monitor confined and nearly crossed out the academic and author <unk> w. <unk> argues that lester 's journey is the story 's center his sexual <unk> through meeting angela is the first of several turning points as he begins to throw off the responsibilities of the comfortable life he has come to <unk> after lester shares a joint with ricky his spirit is released and he begins to rebel against carolyn changed by ricky 's attractive profound confidence lester is convinced that angela is <unk> and sees that he must question his <unk> <unk> <unk> suburban existence he takes a job at a fast @-@ food outlet which allows him to <unk> to a point when he could see his whole life ahead of him <stop>
<start> when lester is caught <unk> by carolyn his angry <unk> about their lack of intimacy is the first time he says aloud what he thinks about her by <unk> the issue and carolyn 's superficial investments in others lester is trying to regain a voice in a home that only respects the voices of mother and daughter his final turning point comes when angela and he almost have sex after she confesses her <unk> he no longer thinks of her as a sex object but as a daughter he holds her close and <unk> her up <unk> called it the most satisfying end to lester 's journey there could possibly have been with these final scenes <unk> intended to show lester at the conclusion of a mythical quest after lester gets a beer from the <unk> the camera pushes toward him then stops facing a <unk> down which he walks to meet his fate having begun to act his age again lester achieves closure as he <unk> at a family photo the camera pans slowly from lester to the kitchen wall onto which blood <unk> as a gunshot rings out the slow pan reflects the peace of lester 's death his body is discovered by jane and ricky <unk> said that ricky 's staring into lester 's dead eyes is the culmination of the theme of the film that beauty is found where it is least expected <stop>
<start> like other american films of <num> — such as fight club bringing out the dead and magnolia american beauty instructs its audience to lead more meaningful lives the film argues the case against conformity but does not deny that people need and want it even the gay characters just want to fit in jim and jim the <unk> other neighbors are a satire of gay <unk> <unk> who invest in the <unk> <unk> that the film criticizes in heterosexual couples the feminist academic and author <unk> r. <unk> argues that american beauty uses its art house <unk> to direct its message of <unk> primarily to the middle classes and that this approach is a cliché of <unk> preoccupation ... the underlying premise being that the luxury of finding an individual self through denial and <unk> is always open to those wealthy enough to choose and <unk> enough to present themselves <unk> as a rebel <stop>
<start> professor roy m. <unk> argues that the film 's thematic center is its direction to the audience to look closer the opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the <unk> neighborhood with lester 's narrated admission that he will soon die forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them it also sets a series of mysteries <unk> asks from what place exactly and from what state of being is he telling this story if he 's already dead why <unk> with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive there is also the question of how lester has died — or will die <unk> believes the preceding scene — jane 's discussion with ricky about the possibility of his killing her father — adds further mystery professor ann c. hall <unk> she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery the film allows the audience to put it aside to view the film and its philosophical issues through this examination of lester 's life <unk> and death american beauty <unk> american middle class notions of meaning beauty and satisfaction even lester 's transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with angela he therefore remains a willing devotee of the popular media 's <unk> of <unk> male sexuality as a sensible route to personal <unk> carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness from her belief in house beautiful domestic <unk> to her car and <unk> outfit carolyn 's domain is a <unk> american <unk> vision of <unk> or eden the <unk> are unaware that they are <unk> philosophically and devout consumers <unk> who expect the <unk> of american beauty to give them happiness <unk> argues that they are helpless in the face of the <unk> economic and sexual stereotypes ... that they and their culture have designated for their salvation <stop>
<start> the film presents ricky as its visionary ... spiritual and mystical center he sees beauty in the <unk> of everyday life <unk> as much as he can for fear of missing it he shows jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed a plastic bag <unk> in the wind in front of a wall he says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was an entire life behind things he feels that sometimes there 's so much beauty in the world i feel like i can 't take it ... and my heart is going to cave in <unk> argues that ricky in looking past the cultural <unk> has grasped the <unk> <unk> of the created world to see god as the film progresses the <unk> move closer to ricky 's view of the world lester only <unk> personal satisfaction at the film 's end on the <unk> of having sex with angela he returns to himself after she admits her <unk> suddenly confronted with a child he begins to treat her as a daughter in doing so lester sees himself angela and his family for the poor and fragile but <unk> creatures they are he looks at a picture of his family in <unk> times and dies having had an <unk> that <unk> him with wonder joy and soul @-@ shaking gratitude — he has finally seen the world as it is <stop>
<start> according to patti <unk> colors are used symbolically throughout the film none more so than red which is an important thematic signature that drives the story and defines lester 's arc first seen in drab colors that reflect his <unk> lester surrounds himself with red as he <unk> his individuality the american beauty rose is repeatedly used as symbol when lester <unk> about angela she is usually naked and surrounded by rose <unk> in these scenes the rose <unk> lester 's desire for her when associated with carolyn the rose represents a façade for suburban success roses are included in almost every shot inside the <unk> home where they signify a mask covering a bleak <unk> reality carolyn feels that as long as there can be <unk> all is well she cuts the <unk> and puts them in <unk> where they adorn her <unk> vision of what makes for beauty and begin to die the <unk> in the vase in the angela – lester seduction scene symbolize lester 's previous life and carolyn the camera pushes in as lester and angela get closer finally taking the <unk> — and thus carolyn — out of the shot lester 's <unk> at the end of the film is expressed by rain and the use of red building to a crescendo that is a deliberate contrast to the release lester feels the constant use of red <unk> the audience <unk> into becoming used to it consequently it leaves the audience unprepared when lester is shot and his blood <unk> on the wall <stop>
<start> <unk> argues that american beauty defines its characters through their sexuality lester 's attempts to relive his youth are a direct result of his lust for angela and the state of his relationship with carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact also sexually frustrated carolyn has an affair that takes her from cold <unk> to a more <unk> soul who sings happily along with the music in her car jane and angela constantly reference sex through angela 's descriptions of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls address each other their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability by the end of the film angela 's hold on jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is lester 's attraction to her col. <unk> reacts with disgust to meeting jim and jim he asks how come these faggots always have to rub it in your face how can they be so <unk> to which ricky replies that 's the thing dad — they don 't feel like it 's anything to be <unk> of <unk> argues that col. <unk> reaction is not <unk> but an <unk> self @-@ <unk> <stop>
<start> with other turn @-@ of @-@ the @-@ millennium films such as fight club in the company of men <num> american <unk> <num> and boys don 't <unk> <num> american beauty raises the broader widely explored issue of <unk> in crisis professor vincent <unk> charges that in their reinforcement of <unk> against threats posed by war by <unk> and by feminist and <unk> challenges these films present a need to focus on and even to privilege aspects of <unk> deemed <unk> lester 's transformation conveys that he and not the woman has borne the brunt of lack of being and he will not stand for being <unk> lester 's attempts to strengthen traditional <unk> conflict with his responsibilities as a father although the film portrays the way lester returns to that role positively he does not become the <unk> figure implicitly celebrated in films like fight club <unk> concludes that lester 's behavior toward angela is a <unk> but nearly necessary step toward his becoming a father again <stop>
<start> <unk> says the film explicitly affirms the importance of upholding the prohibition against <unk> a recurring theme of ball 's work is his comparison of the <unk> against <unk> and homosexuality instead of making an overt distinction american beauty looks at how their repression can lead to violence col. <unk> is so <unk> of his homosexuality that it drives him to murder lester ball said the movie is in part about how homophobia is based in fear and repression and about what they can do the film implies two <unk> <unk> desires lester 's pursuit of angela is a manifestation of his lust for his own daughter while col. <unk> repression is exhibited through the almost <unk> discipline with which he controls ricky consequently ricky realizes that he can only hurt his father by falsely telling him he is homosexual while angela 's vulnerability and submission to lester reminds him of his responsibilities and the limits of his fantasy col. <unk> represents ball 's father whose <unk> homosexual desires led to his own <unk> ball rewrote col. <unk> to delay revealing him as homosexual which <unk> reads as a possible <unk> of ball 's own patriarchal @-@ <unk> fantasies <stop>
<start> american beauty follows a traditional narrative structure only <unk> with the displaced opening scene of jane and ricky from the middle of the story although the plot spans one year the film is narrated by lester at the moment of his death jacqueline <unk> says that the plot occupies ... no time or all time citing lester 's claim that life did not flash before his eyes but that it stretches on forever like an ocean of time <unk> argues that a rhythm of repetition forms the core of the film 's structure for example two scenes have the <unk> sitting down to an evening meal shot from the same angle each image is broadly similar with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by lester 's new @-@ found assertiveness another example is the pair of scenes in which jane and ricky film each other ricky films jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra and the image is reversed later for a similarly <unk> and <unk> scene in which jane films ricky at a vulnerable moment <stop>
<start> lester 's fantasies are emphasized by <unk> and repetitive @-@ motion shots <unk> uses double @-@ and @-@ triple <unk> in several sequences and the score alters to make the audience aware that it is entering a fantasy one example is the <unk> scene — lester 's first encounter with angela while the <unk> perform their half @-@ time routine to on broadway lester becomes increasingly <unk> on angela time slows to represent his <unk> hypnosis and lester begins to <unk> that angela 's performance is for him alone on broadway — which provides a conventional <unk> to the <unk> action — is replaced by discordant <unk> music that lacks melody or progression this <unk> score is important to creating the narrative <unk> in the sequence it conveys a moment for lester that is stretched to an indeterminate length the effect is one that stan link <unk> to vertical time described by the composer and music theorist jonathan kramer as music that <unk> a single present stretched out into an enormous duration a potentially infinite now that nonetheless feels like an instant the music is used like a visual cue so that lester and the score are staring at angela the sequence ends with the sudden reintroduction of on broadway and <unk> time <stop>
<start> according to drew miller of <unk> the soundtrack gives unconscious voice to the characters <unk> and <unk> the subtext the most obvious use of pop music accompanies and gives context to lester 's attempts to recapture his youth reminiscent of how the counterculture of the 1960s <unk> american repression through music and drugs lester begins to smoke cannabis and listen to rock music <unk> song choices progress through the history of american popular music miller argues that although some may be over familiar there is a <unk> element at work making good on the film 's encouragement that viewers look closer toward the end of the film thomas newman 's score features more prominently creating a disturbing tempo that matches the tension of the visuals the exception is don 't let it <unk> you down which plays during angela 's seduction of lester at first appropriate its tone clashes as the seduction stops the lyrics which speak of castles burning can be seen as a metaphor for lester 's view of angela — the <unk> fantasy @-@ driven exterior of the american beauty — as it burns away to reveal the timid small @-@ <unk> girl who like his wife has <unk> developed a false public self <stop>
<start> in <num> alan ball resolved to move into the film industry after several frustrating years writing for the television sitcoms grace under fire and <unk> he joined the united talent agency where his representative andrew <unk> suggested he write a <unk> script to <unk> himself to the town as a screenwriter ball pitched three ideas to <unk> two conventional romantic comedies and american beauty which he had originally conceived as a play in the early 1990s despite the story 's lack of an easily <unk> concept <unk> selected american beauty because he felt it was the one for which ball had the most passion while developing the script ball created another television sitcom oh <unk> up he channeled his anger and frustration at having to <unk> to network demands on that show — and during his <unk> on grace under fire and <unk> — into writing american beauty <stop>
<start> ball did not expect to sell the script believing it would act as more of a calling card but american beauty drew interest from several production bodies <unk> passed the script to several producers including dan <unk> and bruce cohen who took it to dreamworks with the help of executives glenn <unk> and bob cooper and steven spielberg in his capacity as studio partner ball was convinced to develop the project at dreamworks he received <unk> from the studio — known at the time for its more conventional fare — that it would not iron the edges out in an unusual move dreamworks decided not to option the script instead in april <num> the studio bought it outright for <num> @,@ <num> <unk> fox <unk> pictures october films metro @-@ goldwyn @-@ mayer and <unk> entertainment dreamworks planned to make the film for <num> – <num> million <stop>
<start> <unk> and cohen involved ball throughout the film 's development including casting and director selection the producers met with about <num> interested directors several of whom were considered a @-@ list at the time ball was not keen on the more well @-@ known directors because he believed their involvement would increase the budget and lead dreamworks to become nervous about the content nevertheless the studio offered the film to mike nichols and robert <unk> neither accepted in the same year <unk> then a theater director revived the musical <unk> in new york with fellow director rob marshall beth <unk> of the creative artists agency arranged meetings for <unk> with studio figures in los angeles to see if film direction was a possibility <unk> came across american beauty in a pile of eight scripts at <unk> 's house and knew immediately that it was the one he wanted to make early in his career he had been inspired by how the film paris texas <num> presented contemporary america as a mythic landscape and he saw the same theme in american beauty as well as parallels with his own childhood <unk> later met with spielberg impressed by <unk> productions of oliver and <unk> spielberg encouraged him to consider american beauty <stop>
<start> <unk> found that he still had to convince dreamworks production executives to let him direct he had already discussed the film with <unk> and cohen and felt they supported him ball was also keen having seen <unk> he was impressed with <unk> keen visual sense and thought he did not make obvious choices ball felt that <unk> liked to look under the story 's surface a talent he felt would be a good fit with the themes of american beauty <unk> background also <unk> him because of the prominent role the playwright usually has in a theater production over two meetings — the first with cooper walter <unk> and laurie macdonald the second with cooper alone — <unk> pitched himself to the studio the studio soon approached <unk> with a deal to direct for the minimum salary allowed under directors guild of america rules — <num> @,@ <num> <unk> accepted and later recalled that after taxes and his agent 's commission he only earned <num> @,@ <num> in june <num> dreamworks confirmed that it had contracted <unk> to direct the film <stop>
<start> ball was partly inspired by two encounters he had in the early 1990s in about <num> – <num> ball saw a plastic bag blowing in the wind outside the world trade center he watched the bag for <num> minutes saying later that it provoked an unexpected emotional response in <num> ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the amy fisher trial <unk> a comic book telling of the scandal he was struck by how quickly it had become <unk> he said he felt like there was a real story underneath that was more fascinating and way more tragic than the story presented to the public and attempted to turn the idea into a play ball produced around <num> pages but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film he felt that because of the visual themes and because each character 's story was .. intensely personal it could not be done on a stage all the main characters appeared in this version but carolyn did not feature strongly jim and jim instead had much larger roles <stop>
<start> ball based lester 's story on aspects of his own life lester 's re @-@ examination of his life parallels feelings ball had in his mid @-@ 30s like lester ball put aside his <unk> to work in jobs he hated for people he did not respect scenes in ricky 's household reflect ball 's own childhood experiences ball suspected his father was homosexual and used the idea to create col. <unk> a man who gave up his chance to be himself ball said the script 's mix of comedy and drama was not intentional but that it came <unk> from his own outlook on life he said the juxtaposition produced a <unk> contrast giving each trait more impact than if they appeared alone <stop>
<start> in the script that was sent to prospective actors and directors lester and angela had sex by the time of shooting ball had rewritten the scene to the final version ball initially rebuffed counsel from others that he change the script feeling they were being <unk> the final <unk> to alter the scene came from dreamworks then @-@ president walter <unk> he convinced ball by indicating that in greek mythology the hero has a moment of <unk> before ... tragedy occurs ball later said his anger when writing the first draft had blinded him to the idea that lester needed to refuse sex with angela to complete his emotional journey — to achieve redemption <unk> and cohen asked ball not to alter the scene right away as they felt it would be inappropriate to make changes to the script before a director had been hired early drafts also included a flashback to col. <unk> service in the marines a sequence that unequivocally established his homosexual <unk> in love with another marine col. <unk> sees the man die and comes to believe that he is being punished for the sin of being gay ball removed the sequence because it did not fit the structure of the rest of the film — col. <unk> was the only character to have a flashback — and because it removed the element of surprise from col. <unk> later pass at lester ball said he had to write it for his own benefit to know what happened to col. <unk> though all that remained in later drafts was subtext <stop>
<start> ball remained involved throughout production he had signed a television show development deal so had to get permission from his producers to take a year off to be close to american beauty ball was on @-@ set for <unk> and to help interpret his script for all but two days of filming his original <unk> scenes — in which ricky and jane are <unk> for lester 's murder after being framed by col. <unk> — were <unk> in post @-@ production the writer later felt the scenes were unnecessary saying they were a reflection of his anger and cynicism at the time of writing see editing ball and <unk> revised the script twice before it was sent to the actors and twice more before the first read @-@ through <stop>
<start> the shooting script features a scene in angela 's car in which ricky and jane talk about death and beauty the scene differed from earlier versions which set it as a big scene on a freeway in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body the change was a practical decision as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs the schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash but only half a day was available ball agreed but only if the scene could retain a line of ricky 's where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman when you see something like that it 's like god is looking right at you just for a second and if you 're careful you can look right back jane asks and what do you see ricky beauty ball said they wanted to cut that scene they said it 's not important i said you 're out of your fucking mind it 's one of the most important scenes in the movie ... if any one line is the heart and soul of this movie that is the line another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence set in a <unk> it presents a turning point for jane in that she chooses to walk home with ricky instead of going with angela by the end of filming the script had been through <num> drafts <stop>
<start> <unk> had spacey and <unk> in mind for the leads from the beginning but dreamworks executives were <unk> the studio suggested several <unk> including bruce willis kevin <unk> or john <unk> to play lester and helen hunt or holly hunter to play carolyn <unk> did not want a big star weighing the film down he felt spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the <num> films the <unk> <unk> and seven and <num> 's <unk> glen ross spacey was surprised he said i usually play characters who are very quick very <unk> and smart ... i usually <unk> in dark sort of <unk> waters this is a man living one step at a time playing by his instincts this is actually much closer to me to what i am than those other parts <unk> offered <unk> the role of carolyn without the studio 's consent although executives were upset at <unk> by september <num> dreamworks had entered negotiations with spacey and <unk> <stop>
<start> spacey loosely based lester 's early <unk> <unk> on walter <unk> during the film lester 's physique improves from <unk> to toned spacey worked out during filming to improve his body but because <unk> shot the scenes out of chronological order spacey varied <unk> to portray the stages before filming <unk> and spacey analyzed jack <unk> 's performance in the <unk> <num> because <unk> wanted spacey to emulate the way <unk> moved the way he looked the way he was in that office and the way he was an ordinary man and yet a special man spacey 's <unk> is a <unk> to sunset boulevard <num> which is also narrated in <unk> by a dead character <unk> felt it evoked lester 's — and the film 's — loneliness <unk> recalled women from her youth to inform her performance i used to <unk> constantly you 'd go to church and see how people present themselves on the outside and then be inside their house and see the difference <unk> and a hair stylist collaborated to create a <unk> president <unk> hairstyle and <unk> and production designer <unk> <unk> researched mail @-@ order <unk> to better establish carolyn 's environment of a spotless suburban manor to help <unk> get into carolyn 's mindset <unk> gave her music that he believed carolyn would like he lent <unk> the bobby <unk> version of the song don 't rain on my parade which she enjoyed and persuaded the director to include it for a scene in which carolyn sings in her car <stop>
<start> for the roles of jane ricky and angela dreamworks gave <unk> <unk> <unk> by november <num> <unk> birch wes bentley and mena <unk> had been cast in the parts — in birch 's case despite the fact she was <unk> for her nude scene as birch was <num> at the time she made the film and thus classified as a minor in the united states her parents had to approve her brief <unk> scene in the movie child labor representatives and they were on the set for the shooting of the scene bentley <unk> competition from top actors under the age of <num> to be cast the <num> documentary my big break followed bentley and several other young actors before and after he landed the part to prepare <unk> provided bentley with a video camera telling the actor to film what ricky would peter gallagher and alison <unk> were cast as <unk> kane and barbara <unk> after filming began in december <num> <unk> gave <unk> a book of paintings by <unk> <unk> he told her your character is in there somewhere <unk> cut much of barbara 's dialogue including conversations between colonel <unk> and her as he felt that what needed to be said about the pair — their humanity and vulnerability — was conveyed successfully through their shared moments of silence chris cooper plays colonel <unk> scott bakula plays jim <unk> and sam <unk> plays jim berkley jim and jim were deliberately depicted as the most normal happy — and boring — couple in the film ball 's inspiration for the characters came from a thought he had after seeing a bland boring heterosexual couple who wore matching clothes i can 't wait for the time when a gay couple can be just as boring ball also included aspects of a gay couple he knew who had the same <unk> <stop>
<start> <unk> insisted on two weeks of cast rehearsals although the sessions were not as formal as he was used to in the theater and the actors could not be present at every one several <unk> and suggestions by the actors were incorporated into the script an early scene showing the <unk> leaving home for work was inserted later on to show the low point that carolyn and lester 's relationship had reached spacey and <unk> worked to create a sense of the love that lester and carolyn once had for one another for example the scene in which lester almost <unk> carolyn after the pair argues over lester 's buying a car was originally strictly contentious <stop>
<start> principal photography lasted about <num> days from december <num> <num> to february <num> american beauty was filmed on soundstages at the warner bros. <unk> in burbank california and at hancock park and <unk> in los angeles the aerial shots at the beginning and end of the film were captured in <unk> california and many of the school scenes were shot at south high school in <unk> california several extras in the gym crowd were south high students the film is set in an upper middle @-@ class neighborhood in an unidentified american town production designer <unk> <unk> likened the <unk> to <unk> illinois but said it 's not about a place it 's about an <unk> ... the milieu was pretty much <unk> usa — <unk> mobile <unk> the intent was for the setting to reflect the characters who are also <unk> <unk> said all of them are very strained and their lives are <unk> the <unk> household was designed as the reverse of the <unk> — the former a pristine ideal but <unk> and lacking in inner balance leading to carolyn 's desire to at least give it the appearance of a perfect all @-@ american household the <unk> home is depicted in exaggerated darkness and symmetry <stop>
<start> the production selected two adjacent properties on the warner <unk> 's <unk> street for the <unk> and <unk> homes the crew rebuilt the houses to incorporate false rooms that established lines of sight — between ricky and jane 's bedroom windows and between ricky 's bedroom and lester 's garage the garage windows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which col. <unk> — watching from ricky 's bedroom — mistakenly assumes that lester is paying ricky for sex <unk> made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of familiarity with the shot the house interiors were filmed on the <unk> on location and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed the inside of the <unk> home was shot at a house close to interstate <num> and sunset boulevard in los angeles the inside of the <unk> home was shot in the city 's hancock park neighborhood ricky 's bedroom was designed to be cell @-@ like to suggest his <unk> personality while at the same time blending with the high @-@ tech equipment to reflect his <unk> side the production deliberately <unk> the use of red as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere the <unk> home uses cool blues while the <unk> is kept in a depressed military palette <stop>
<start> <unk> dominating visual style was deliberate and composed with a <unk> design that provided a sparse almost surreal feeling — a bright <unk> hard edged near <unk> @-@ like take on american <unk> <unk> constantly directed his set <unk> to empty the frame he made lester 's fantasy scenes more fluid and graceful and <unk> made minimal use of <unk> feeling that stable shots generated more tension for example when <unk> used a slow push in to the <unk> dinner table he held the shot because his training as a theater director taught him the importance of putting distance between the characters he wanted to keep the tension in the scene so he only cut away when jane left the table <unk> did use a hand @-@ held camera for the scene in which col. <unk> beats ricky <unk> said the camera provided the scene with a <unk> ... off @-@ balance energy he also went hand @-@ held for the <unk> of ricky 's <unk> footage <unk> took a long time to get the quality of ricky 's footage to the level he wanted for the plastic @-@ bag footage <unk> used wind machines to move the bag in the air the scene took four takes two by the second unit did not satisfy <unk> so he shot the scene himself he felt his first take lacked grace but for the last attempt he changed the location to the front of a brick wall and added leaves on the ground <unk> was satisfied by the way the wall gave definition to the outline of the bag <stop>
<start> <unk> avoided using close @-@ ups as he believed the technique was <unk> he also cited spielberg 's advice that he should imagine an audience <unk> at the bottom of the camera monitor to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a <num> @-@ foot <num> m screen spielberg — who visited the set a few times — also advised <unk> not to worry about costs if he had a great idea toward the end of a long working day <unk> said that happened three or four times and they are all in the movie despite spielberg 's support dreamworks and <unk> fought constantly over the schedule and budget although the studio <unk> little with the film 's content spacey <unk> and hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates american beauty cost dreamworks <num> million to produce slightly above their projected sum <unk> was so dissatisfied with his first three days filming that he obtained permission from dreamworks to <unk> the scenes he said i started with a wrong scene actually a comedy scene and the actors played it way too big ... it was badly shot my fault badly composed my fault bad costumes my fault ... and everybody was doing what i was asking it was all my fault aware that he was a novice <unk> drew on the experience of hall i made a very conscious decision early on if i didn 't understand something technically to say without embarrassment i don 't understand what you 're talking about please explain it <stop>
<start> <unk> encouraged some improvisation for example when lester <unk> in bed beside carolyn the director asked spacey to improvise several <unk> for the act in each take <unk> said i wanted that not just because it was funny ... but because i didn 't want it to seem <unk> i wanted it to seem like he was <unk> it out of his mouth without thinking spacey is so in control — i wanted him to break through spacey obliged eventually coming up with <num> phrases but <unk> could not always keep a straight face which meant the scene had to be shot <num> times the production used small amounts of computer @-@ generated imagery most of the rose <unk> in lester 's fantasies were added in post @-@ production although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed when lester <unk> about angela in a rose @-@ <unk> bath the steam was real save for in the overhead shot to position the camera a hole had to be cut in the ceiling through which the steam escaped it was instead added digitally <stop>
<start> american beauty was edited by christopher <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> began in the position but had to leave halfway through post @-@ production because of a scheduling conflict with me myself and irene <num> in which chris cooper also starred <unk> and an assistant edited the film for <num> days between the appointments <unk> realized during editing that the film was different from the one he had envisioned he believed he had been making a much more whimsical ... <unk> film than what came together in the edit suite instead <unk> was drawn to the emotion and darkness he began to use the score and shots he had intended to <unk> to craft the film along these lines in total he cut about <num> minutes from his original edit the opening included a dream in which lester imagines himself flying above the town <unk> spent two days filming spacey against <unk> but removed the sequence as he believed it to be too whimsical — like a <unk> brothers movie — and therefore inappropriate for the tone he was trying to set the opening in the final cut reused a scene from the middle of the film where jane tells ricky to kill her father this scene was to be the revelation to the audience that the pair was not responsible for lester 's death as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that jane 's request was not serious however in the portion he used in the opening — and when the full scene plays out later — <unk> used the score and a reaction shot of ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt the subsequent shot — an aerial view of the neighborhood — was originally intended as the plate shot for the <unk> effects in the dream sequence <stop>
<start> <unk> spent more time <unk> the first <num> minutes than the rest of the film taken together he <unk> several versions of the opening the first edit included <unk> scenes in which jane and ricky are convicted of lester 's murder but <unk> <unk> these in the last week of editing because he felt they made the film lose its mystery and because they did not fit with the theme of redemption that had emerged during production <unk> believed the trial drew focus away from the characters and turned the film into an episode of <unk> blue instead he wanted the ending to be a poetic mixture of dream and memory and narrative resolution when ball first saw a completed edit it was a version with truncated versions of these scenes he felt that they were so short that they didn 't really register <unk> and he argued but ball was more accepting after <unk> cut the sequences completely ball felt that without the scenes the film was more optimistic and had evolved into something that for all its darkness had a really romantic heart <stop>
<start> conrad hall was not the first choice for director of photography <unk> believed he was too old and too experienced to want the job and he had been told that hall was difficult to work with instead <unk> asked fred <unk> who turned the job down because he did not like the script hall was recommended to <unk> by tom cruise because of hall 's work on without <unk> <num> which cruise had executive produced <unk> was directing cruise 's then @-@ wife nicole kidman in the play the blue room during <unk> on american beauty and had already <unk> the whole film hall was involved for one month during <unk> his ideas for lighting the film began with his first reading of the script and further passes allowed him to refine his approach before meeting <unk> hall was initially concerned that audiences would not like the characters he only felt able to identify with them during cast rehearsals which gave him fresh ideas on his approach to the visuals <stop>
<start> hall 's approach was to create peaceful compositions that evoked <unk> to contrast with the turbulent on @-@ screen events and allow audiences to take in the action hall and <unk> first discussed the intended mood of a scene but he was allowed to light the shot in any way he felt necessary in most cases hall first lit the scene 's subject by painting in the blacks and whites before adding fill light which he reflected from <unk> or white card on the ceiling this approach gave hall more control over the shadows while keeping the fill light <unk> and the dark areas free of spill hall shot american beauty in a <num> @.@ <num> <num> aspect ratio in the super <num> format using <unk> vision <unk> <unk> <num> mm film stock he used super <num> partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners of the <unk> @-@ filled pool in its overhead shot creating a frame around angela within he shot the whole film at the same t @-@ stop <unk> given his preference for shooting that wide hall favored high @-@ speed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects he used <unk> platinum cameras with the company 's <unk> series of prime and <unk> lenses hall employed <unk> vision <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> stock for scenes with daylight effects he had difficulty adjusting to <unk> 's newly introduced vision release print stock which combined with his contrast @-@ heavy lighting style created a look with too much contrast hall contacted <unk> who sent him a batch of <unk> that was <num> lower in contrast hall used a <num> <num> inch <unk> black <unk> filter for almost every scene which he said in <unk> may not have been the best choice as the optical steps required to blow super <num> up for its <unk> release print led to a slight amount of degradation therefore the <unk> from the filter was not required when he saw the film in a theater hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter the <unk> from the super <num> – <unk> conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended <stop>
<start> a shot where lester and ricky share a cannabis joint behind a building came from a misunderstanding between hall and <unk> <unk> asked hall to prepare the shot in his absence hall assumed the characters would look for privacy so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building intending to light from the top of the truck when <unk> returned he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen he removed the truck and hall had to rethink the lighting he lit it from the left with a large light crossing the actors and with a soft light behind the camera hall felt the consequent wide shot worked perfectly for the tone of the scene hall made sure to keep rain or the suggestion of it in every shot near the end of the film in one shot during lester 's encounter with angela at the <unk> home hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights in another he partly lit the pair through french windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower intensifying the light although the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene hall felt it justified because of the strong contrasts it produced for the close @-@ ups when lester and angela move to the <unk> hall tried to keep rain in the frame lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind lester he also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room <stop>
<start> thomas newman 's score was recorded in santa monica california he mainly used percussion instruments to create the mood and rhythm the inspiration for which was provided by <unk> newman favored pulse rhythm and color over melody making for a more <unk> score than he had previously created he built each cue around small <unk> repeating phrases — often the only variety through a thinning of the texture for eight bars the percussion instruments included <unk> <unk> <unk> piano <unk> and <unk> also featured were guitars flute and world music instruments newman also used electronic music and on <unk> tracks employed more unorthodox methods such as tapping metal mixing bowls with a finger and using a <unk> mandolin newman believed the score helped move the film along without disturbing the moral ambiguity of the script it was a real delicate balancing act in terms of what music worked to preserve that <stop>
<start> the soundtrack features songs by newman bobby <unk> the who free <unk> the <unk> who bill <unk> betty carter peggy lee the folk <unk> gomez and bob dylan as well as two cover versions — the beatles because performed by elliott smith and neil young 's don 't let it <unk> you down performed by annie lennox produced by the film 's music supervisor chris <unk> an abridged soundtrack album was released on october <num> <num> and went on to be nominated for a grammy award for best soundtrack album an album featuring <num> tracks from newman 's score was released on january <num> <num> and won the grammy award for best score soundtrack album <unk> considered the score to be one of newman 's best saying it enabled the film 's <unk> aspirations in <num> the magazine chose the score as one of <num> essential soundtracks it believed spoke to the complex and innovative relationships between music and screen storytelling <stop>

<start> <unk> led the <unk> to victory in <num> against sullivan 's successor levi lincoln sr. who had taken over as acting governor upon sullivan 's death late in <num> during <unk> 's term the principal domestic issue occupying state politics was a banking crisis stimulated by the federal policy of <unk> trade with great britain and france then embroiled in the napoleonic wars although the crisis caused a number of bank failures in new england massachusetts banks largely escaped unscathed <stop>

<start> <unk> wrote ... for even if he was not the instigator of the emperor 's death he was at least privy to it as he openly admitted for he used afterwards to <unk> mushrooms the vehicle in which the poison was administered to claudius as the food of the gods as the greek <unk> has it at any rate after claudius death he vented on him every kind of insult in act and word charging him now with <unk> and now with cruelty for it was a favourite joke of his to say that claudius had ceased to play the fool among mortals <unk> the first syllable of the word <unk> and he <unk> many of his decrees and acts as the work of a <unk> and a <unk> finally he neglected to <unk> the place where his body was burned except with a low and mean wall <stop>
<start> according to <unk> <unk> became emperor at the age of <num> when the news of claudius death was made known making him the youngest emperor at that time although what <unk> may have meant is that he was in his seventeenth year as his date of birth also listed by <unk> would have made him <num> at the time of claudius death <unk> in book xiii of his annals describes <unk> as being scarcely out of his <unk> at the time he became emperor ancient historians describe <unk> 's early reign as being strongly influenced by his mother <unk> his tutor lucius <unk> seneca and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> especially in the first year other tutors were less often mentioned such as alexander of <unk> <stop>
<start> very early in <unk> 's rule problems arose from competition for influence between <unk> and <unk> 's two main advisers seneca and <unk> <unk> also attempted to influence the young <unk> <unk> also is mentioned by ancient sources as <unk> for her son <unk> this <unk> continued as is evidenced by the coin of the both of them it is extremely unusual to see a women 's face on a coin in the ancient world it is because of this position of power <unk> felt jealous as seneca in particular rose up in <unk> 's court as he offered the advice <unk> wanted to hear unlike his mother <stop>
<start> in <num> <unk> tried to sit down next to <unk> while he met with an armenian envoy but seneca stopped her and prevented a <unk> scene as it was <unk> at that time for a woman to be in the same room as men doing official business <unk> 's friends also <unk> <unk> and told <unk> to <unk> of his mother <stop>

<start> at this time a <unk> arrived with a report that the senate had declared <unk> a public enemy and that it was their intention to execute him by beating him to death and that armed men had been sent to apprehend him for the act to take place in the <unk> the senate actually was still reluctant and <unk> on the right course of action as <unk> was the last member of the julio @-@ <unk> family indeed most of the <unk> had served the imperial family all their lives and felt a sense of loyalty to the deified bloodline if not to <unk> himself the men actually had the goal of returning <unk> back to the senate where the senate hoped to work out a compromise with the <unk> governors that would preserve <unk> 's life so that at least a future heir to the dynasty could be produced <stop>
<start> <unk> however did not know this and at the news brought by the <unk> he prepared himself for suicide pacing up and down <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which translates to english as what an artist dies in me <unk> his <unk> he first <unk> for one of his companions to set an example by first killing himself at last the sound of approaching horsemen drove <unk> to face the end however he still could not bring himself to take his own life but instead he forced his private secretary <unk> to perform the task <stop>

<start> according to <unk> and <unk> <unk> the people of rome celebrated the death of <unk> <unk> though describes a more complicated political environment <unk> mentions that <unk> 's death was welcomed by senators nobility and the upper class the lower @-@ class slaves <unk> of the arena and the theater and those who were supported by the famous excesses of <unk> on the other hand were upset with the news members of the military were said to have mixed feelings as they had allegiance to <unk> but were <unk> to overthrow him <stop>
<start> eastern sources namely <unk> ii and <unk> of <unk> mention that <unk> 's death was <unk> as he restored the liberties of <unk> with a wisdom and <unk> quite alien to his character and that he held our liberties in his hand and respected them <stop>
<start> modern scholarship generally holds that while the senate and more well @-@ off individuals welcomed <unk> 's death the general populace was loyal to the end and beyond for <unk> and <unk> both thought it worthwhile to appeal to their nostalgia <stop>
<start> <unk> 's name was erased from some monuments in what edward <unk> regards as an outburst of private zeal many portraits of <unk> were reworked to represent other figures according to eric r. <unk> over fifty such images survive this reworking of images is often explained as part of the way in which the memory of disgraced emperors was condemned posthumously see <unk> <unk> <unk> however doubts that the practice is necessarily negative and notes that some continued to create images of <unk> long after his death <stop>
<start> the civil war during the year of the four <unk> was described by ancient historians as a <unk> period according to <unk> this instability was rooted in the fact that emperors could no longer rely on the perceived legitimacy of the imperial bloodline as <unk> and those before him could <unk> began his short reign with the execution of many allies of <unk> and possible future enemies one such notable enemy included <unk> <unk> who claimed to be the son of emperor <unk> <stop>

<start> the history of <unk> 's reign is problematic in that no historical sources survived that were contemporary with <unk> these first histories at one time did exist and were described as biased and <unk> either overly critical or praising of <unk> the original sources were also said to contradict on a number of events nonetheless these lost primary sources were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on <unk> written by the next generations of historians a few of the contemporary historians are known by name <unk> <unk> <unk> rufus and pliny the elder all wrote condemning histories on <unk> that are now lost there were also pro @-@ <unk> histories but it is unknown who wrote them or for what <unk> <unk> was praised <stop>

<start> <unk> is a large genus of <unk> native to mexico the caribbean central and south america this <unk> <unk> non @-@ spiny genus includes both small <unk> lacking an <unk> stem and large trees the genus has a complicated taxonomic history and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers since the genera can only be distinguished on the basis of their male flowers the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus this has been supported by a recent molecular phylogeny <stop>
<start> somewhere between <num> and <num> species are recognised in the genus with estimates of as many as <num> <unk> <unk> collections make it difficult to determine whether certain groups represent single species or groups of similar species <unk> species have a long history of human use and include economically important sources of palm oil and fibre many species are fire tolerant and thrive in disturbed habitats their seeds are animal dispersed including some which are thought to have been adapted for dispersal by now @-@ extinct pleistocene <unk> <stop>

<start> <unk> are large branched and borne among the leaves the <unk> consists of a main axis — the <unk> and the <unk> — and a series of smaller branches the <unk> the <unk> which bear the flowers emerge from the <unk> the <unk> is the main stalk connecting the <unk> with the stem <unk> either consist entirely of male flowers or are predominantly female with a few male flowers fruit usually have two or three seeds although fewer or more are present in some species and are usually brown yellow orange @-@ brown or purple when mature <stop>
<start> four different types of male flowers exist on the basis of these flower types the genus has often been split into four genera — a more narrowly defined <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the species sometimes referred to <unk> have coiled <unk> while the other groups have straight ones the <unk> of those placed in <unk> are much shorter than the <unk> while those placed in <unk> and a more narrowly defined <unk> have <unk> that are longer than the <unk> five species do not fit easily into any of these groups this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus <stop>
<start> <unk> has been placed in the subfamily <unk> the tribe <unk> and the <unk> <unk> together with the genera <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> within this <unk> <unk> has been found to be a monophyletic group and sister to the clade containing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <stop>
<start> <unk> exists as to whether <unk> should be considered a single genus or a group of related genera in their <num> field guide to the <unk> of the americas andrew henderson gloria <unk> and <unk> <unk> combined all the species in the <unk> <unk> as it was then defined into a single genus <unk> in his <num> <unk> treatment of palm <unk> <unk> american botanist sidney f. <unk> divided the group into five genera — a more narrowly defined <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and john <unk> recognised a single genus in their <num> world <unk> of <unk> and jean @-@ christophe <unk> continued this usage in his <num> review of the genus <stop>
<start> the multi @-@ genus approach is based solely on the structure of the male flowers no other characters could be consistently associated with one genus or another four of the genera — <unk> in a narrow sense <unk> <unk> and <unk> — correspond to four different types of male flowers found within the genus however a few species have flowers that are intermediate between these four types including a. <unk> which <unk> placed in its own genus <unk> and this has been used as an argument for the single @-@ genus approach in addition there are several hybrids between species that would be considered different genera under <unk> 's five @-@ genus system which has also been used as an argument for placing them in a single genus in <num> alan <unk> and colleagues published a molecular phylogeny of the <unk> which found that some species placed in <unk> were actually more closely related to species placed in <unk> than they were to other members of that genus if the five @-@ genus approach was used while a. <unk> placed in <unk> by <unk> was actually a sister to both <unk> and <unk> <stop>

<start> violence reached a peak on <num> august <num> culminating in the battle of the <unk> — a three @-@ day pitched battle between residents and the <unk> on <num> august units of the british army were deployed at the edge of the <unk> and the <unk> were withdrawn the derry citizens defence association <unk> declared their intention to hold the area against both the <unk> and the british army until their demands were met the british army made no attempt to enter the area the situation continued until october <num> when following publication of the hunt report military police were allowed in <stop>
<start> the irish republican army ira began to re @-@ arm and recruit after august <num> in december <num> it split into the official ira and the provisional ira both were supported by the people of the free derry area meanwhile relations between the british army and the nationalist community which were initially good deteriorated in july <num> there was a surge of recruitment into the ira after two young men were shot and killed by british troops the government introduced <unk> on <num> august <num> and in response barricades went up once more in the <unk> and <unk> this time free derry was a no @-@ go area defended by armed members of both the official and provisional ira from within the area they launched attacks on the british army and the <unk> began a bombing campaign in the city centre as before unarmed <unk> manned the barricades and crime was dealt with by a voluntary body known as the free derry police <stop>
<start> support for the ira increased further after bloody sunday in january <num> when thirteen unarmed men and boys were shot dead by the british army 's parachute regiment at a march in the <unk> a 14th man was wounded and died <num> ½ months later the support began to <unk> after the killing by the official ira of a local youth who was home on leave from the british army after a provisional ira ceasefire during which it entered talks with the british government broke down the british took the decision to move against the no @-@ go areas free derry came to an end on <num> july <num> when thousands of british troops moved in with armoured cars and <unk> to occupy the area <stop>
<start> derry city lies near the border between northern ireland and the republic of ireland it has a majority nationalist population and nationalists won a majority of seats in the <num> local elections despite this the ulster unionist party controlled the local council <unk> corporation from <num> onwards the <unk> maintained their majority firstly by manipulating the constituency boundaries <unk> so that the south ward with a nationalist majority returned eight councillors while the much smaller north ward and <unk> ward with unionist <unk> returned twelve councillors between them <unk> by allowing only <unk> to vote in local elections rather than one man one vote so that a higher number of nationalists who did not own homes were disenfranchised and <unk> by denying houses to nationalists outside the south ward constituency the result was that there were about <num> @,@ <num> nationalist families and practically no unionists on the housing waiting list and that housing in the nationalist area was crowded and of a very poor condition the south ward comprised the <unk> <unk> <unk> bishop street and foyle road and it was this area that would become free derry <stop>
<start> the derry housing action committee <unk> was formed in march <num> by members of the derry branch of the northern ireland labour party and the james <unk> republican club including <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> it disrupted a meeting of <unk> corporation in march <num> and in may blocked traffic by placing a caravan that was home to a family of four in the middle of the <unk> road in the <unk> and staging a sit @-@ down protest at the opening of the second deck of the <unk> bridge after the meeting of <unk> corporation was again disrupted in august <unk> <unk> telephoned the northern ireland civil rights association <unk> and invited them to hold a march in derry the date chosen was <num> october <num> an <unk> committee was formed although in reality most of the organizing was done by <unk> and <unk> and the route was to take the <unk> inside the city walls where nationalists were traditionally not permitted to march the minister of home affairs william craig made an order on <num> october prohibiting the march on the grounds that the <unk> boys of derry were intending to hold a march on the same day in the words of martin <unk> of <unk> this particular tactic ... provided the excuse needed to ban the march when the <unk> attempted to defy the ban on <num> october they were stopped by a royal ulster constabulary <unk> cordon the police drew their <unk> and struck <unk> including <unk> mp eddie <unk> and westminster mp gerry <unk> subsequently the police broke ranks and used their <unk> <unk> on people in duke street <unk> trying to escape met another party of police and these police also used their <unk> <unk> water cannons were also used the police action caused outrage in the nationalist area of derry and at a meeting four days later the derry citizens action committee <unk> was formed with john hume as chairman and ivan cooper as vice @-@ chairman <stop>
<start> another group formed as a result of the events of <num> october was people 's democracy a group of students in queen 's university belfast they organised a march from belfast to derry in support of civil rights starting out with about forty young people on <num> january <num> the march met with violent opposition from loyalist counter @-@ demonstrators at several points along the route finally at <unk> bridge five miles outside derry they were attacked by a mob of about two hundred wielding clubs — some of them studded with nails — and stones half of the attackers were later identified from press photographs as members of the b @-@ <unk> the police who were at the scene <unk> to the b @-@ <unk> as they prepared their ambush and then failed to protect the <unk> many of whom ran into the river and were <unk> with stones from the bank dozens of <unk> were taken to hospital the remainder continued on to derry where they were attacked once more on their way to <unk> bridge before they finally reached guildhall square where they held a rally <unk> broke out after the rally police drove <unk> into the <unk> but did not come after them in the early hours of the following morning <num> january members of the <unk> charged into st. <unk> 's wells and <unk> road in the <unk> breaking windows and beating residents in his report on the disturbances lord cameron remarked that for such conduct among members of a disciplined and well @-@ led force there can be no acceptable justification or excuse and added that its effect in <unk> <unk> and inspiring hostility towards the police was <unk> great <stop>
<start> that afternoon over <num> @,@ <num> <unk> residents built barricades armed themselves with steel bars wooden clubs and <unk> and told the police that they would not be allowed into the area <unk> chairman john hume told a meeting of residents that they were to defend the area and no @-@ one was to come in groups of men wearing <unk> patrolled the streets in shifts john <unk> casey a local activist painted you are now entering free derry in white paint on the gable wall of a house on the corner of <unk> road and <unk> street that corner which was a popular venue for meetings later became known as free derry corner on <num> january the <unk> area was extended to include the <unk> another nationalist area on a hill overlooking the <unk> a clandestine radio station calling itself radio free derry began broadcasting to residents playing rebel songs and encouraging resistance on a small number of occasions law @-@ <unk> attempted crimes but were dealt with by the patrols despite all this the irish times reported that the infrastructure of revolutionary control in the area has not been developed beyond the maintenance of patrols following some acts of destruction and of violence late in the week members of the <unk> including ivan cooper addressed residents on friday <num> january and called on them to <unk> the barricades the barricades were taken down the following morning <stop>
<start> over the next three months there were violent clashes with local youths throwing stones at police violence came to a head on saturday <num> april after a planned march from <unk> bridge to the city centre was banned a protest in the city centre led to clashes with <unk> — unionists in sympathy with the anti @-@ civil rights stance of ian paisley police attempting to drive the protesters back into the <unk> were themselves driven back to their barracks a series of pitched battles followed and barricades were built often under the supervision of <unk> devlin newly elected mp for mid ulster police pursuing <unk> broke into a house in william street and severely beat the <unk> samuel <unk> his family and two friends <unk> was brought to hospital bleeding <unk> from a number of head wounds at midnight four hundred <unk> men in full riot gear and carrying riot shields occupied the <unk> <unk> of police vehicles drove through the area with <unk> <unk> <stop>
<start> the following day several thousand residents led by the <unk> withdrew to the <unk> and issued an ultimatum to the <unk> — withdraw within two hours or be driven out with fifteen minutes of the two hours remaining the police marched out through the <unk> 's gate even as the residents were entering from the far side the barricades were not maintained on this occasion and routine patrols were not prevented <stop>
<start> samuel <unk> suffered a heart attack four days after his beating on <num> july he suffered a further heart attack and died thousands attended his funeral and the mood was sufficiently angry that it was clear the annual <unk> boys parade scheduled for <num> august could not take place without causing serious disturbance <stop>
<start> the <unk> boys parade is an annual celebration by unionists of the relief of the siege of derry in <num> which began when thirteen young apprentice boys shut the city 's gates against the army of king james at that time the parade was held on <num> august each year participants from across northern ireland and britain marched along the city walls above the <unk> and were often openly hostile to the residents on <num> july <num> the derry citizens defence association <unk> was formed to try to preserve peace during the period of the parade and to defend the <unk> and <unk> in the event of an attack the chairman was <unk> <unk> an irish republican army ira veteran the vice @-@ chairman was paddy doherty a popular local man sometimes known as paddy <unk> and the secretary was <unk> white another leading republican and leader of the james <unk> republican club street committees were formed under the overall command of the <unk> and barricades were built on the night of <num> august the parade took place as planned on <num> august as it passed through waterloo place on the edge of the <unk> hostilities began between supporters and opponents of the parade fighting between the two groups continued for two hours then the police joined in they charged up william street against the <unk> followed by the <unk> they were met with a hail of stones and petrol bombs the ensuing battle became known as the battle of the <unk> late in the evening having been driven back repeatedly the police fired <unk> of <unk> gas into the crowd <unk> on the roof of a high @-@ rise block of flats on <unk> street threw petrol bombs down on the police <unk> @-@ <unk> were used to maintain contact between different areas of fighting and <unk> headquarters in paddy doherty 's house in westland street and first aid stations were operating staffed by doctors nurses and volunteers women and girls made milk @-@ bottle <unk> of petrol bombs for supply to the youths in the front line and radio free derry broadcast to the fighters and their families on the third day of fighting <num> august the northern ireland government mobilised the ulster special constabulary b @-@ <unk> a force greatly feared by nationalists in derry and elsewhere before they engaged however british troops were deployed at the scene carrying automatic rifles and sub @-@ machine guns the <unk> and b @-@ <unk> withdrew and the troops took up positions outside the <unk> area <stop>
<start> a <unk> that included <unk> <unk> met senior army officers and told them that the army would not be allowed in until certain demands were met including the <unk> of the <unk> the disbandment of the b @-@ <unk> and the abolition of <unk> the parliament and government of northern ireland the officers agreed that neither troops nor police would enter the <unk> and <unk> districts a peace corps was formed to maintain law and order when the british home secretary jim <unk> visited northern ireland and announced his intention to visit the <unk> on <num> august he was told that he would not be allowed to bring either police or soldiers with him <unk> agreed <unk> by members of the defence committee he was swept along by a <unk> crowd of thousands up <unk> street and into <unk> road where he took refuge in a local house and later addressed crowds from an upstairs window in preparation for <unk> 's visit the free derry wall was painted white and the you are now entering free derry sign was professionally re @-@ painted in black <unk> <stop>
<start> following <unk> 's visit some barricades were breached but the majority remained while the people awaited concrete evidence of reform still the army made no move to enter the area law and order was maintained by a peace corps — volunteers organised by the <unk> to patrol the streets and man the barricades there was very little crime <unk> in the words of <unk> <unk> as often as not consisted of a stern lecture from <unk> <unk> on the need for solidarity within the area in september the barricades were replaced with a white line painted on the road <stop>
<start> the hunt report on the future of policing in northern ireland was presented to the <unk> cabinet in early october jim <unk> held talks with the cabinet in belfast on <num> october following which the report 's recommendations were accepted and made public they included the recommendation that the <unk> should be ordinarily unarmed and that the b @-@ <unk> should be phased out and replaced by a new force the new <unk> chief constable arthur young an <unk> was announced and travelled to belfast with <unk> the same day <unk> <unk> announced that the <unk> was to be dissolved on <num> october <unk> and young visited free derry and on <num> october the first military police entered the <unk> on foot and unarmed <stop>
<start> the irish republican army ira had been inactive militarily since the end of the border campaign in <num> it was low in both personnel and equipment — chief of staff <unk> <unk> told <unk> <unk> and paddy doherty in august <num> that he couldn 't defend the <unk> i haven 't the men nor the guns to do it during the 1960s the leadership of the republican movement had moved to the left its focus was on class struggle and its aim was to unite the irish nationalist and unionist working classes in order to overthrow capitalism both british and irish republican <unk> were formed in northern ireland where <unk> <unk> was proscribed these clubs were involved in the formation of <unk> in <num> in derry the james <unk> republican club worked closely with labour party radicals with whom they set up the derry housing action committee and derry <unk> action committee the derry citizens defence association was formed initially by <unk> who then invited other nationalists to join although there were tensions between the younger leaders like <unk> white and the older traditional <unk> such as <unk> <unk> both sides saw the unrest of <num> @-@ <num> as a chance to advance republican aims and the two shared the platform at the easter rising commemoration in april <num> <stop>
<start> the events of august <num> in derry and more particularly in belfast where the ira was unable to prevent loss of life or protect families burned out of their homes brought to a head the divisions that had already appeared within the movement between the radicals and the <unk> and led to a split in december <num> into the official ira and the provisional ira initially both armies organised for defensive purposes only although the <unk> were planning towards an offensive campaign in derry there was far less hostility between the two organisations than elsewhere and <unk> commonly paid subscriptions to both when <unk> were arrested after the official 's easter parade in march <num> officials and <unk> <unk> their trial together at the start the officials attracted most of the younger members martin mcguinness who in august <num> had helped defend the barricades initially joined the officials but a few months later left to join the <unk> <stop>
<start> relations between the british army and the residents had steadily decayed since the first appearance of troops in august <num> in september after clashes between nationalist and unionist crowds that led to the death of a protestant man william king the british army erected a peace ring to <unk> the nationalist population in the area they had previously controlled roads into the city centre were closed at night and people were prevented from walking on certain streets although some moderate nationalists accepted this as necessary there was anger among young people <unk> between youths and troops became more frequent the riot following the officials easter parade in march <num> marked the first time that the army used <unk> squads who rushed into the <unk> wielding <unk> to make arrests the <unk> squads soon became a common feature of army arrest operations there was also a belief that they were arresting people at random sometimes days after the alleged offence and based on the identification of people that they had seen from a considerable distance the <unk> were condemned as <unk> by <unk> who saw the riots as hampering attempts to resolve the situation the labour radicals and official <unk> still working together tried to turn the youth away from rioting and create socialist organizations — one such organization was named the young <unk> association — but to no <unk> the <unk> while <unk> of riots viewed them as the inevitable consequence of british occupation this philosophy was more attractive to <unk> and some of them joined the provisional ira the deaths of two leading <unk> in a premature explosion in june <num> resulted in young militants becoming more prominent in the organization nevertheless up to july <num> the provisional ira remained numerically small <stop>
<start> two men <unk> <unk> and desmond beattie were shot dead in separate incidents in the early morning and afternoon of <num> july <num> they were the first people to be killed by the british army in derry in both cases the british army claimed that the men were attacking them with guns or bombs while <unk> insisted that both were unarmed the social democratic and labour party <unk> the newly formed party of which john hume and ivan cooper were leading members withdrew from <unk> in protest but among residents there was a perception that moderate policies had failed the result was a surge of support for the ira the <unk> held a meeting the following sunday at which they called on people to join the ira following the meeting people <unk> up to join and there was large @-@ scale rioting the british army post at <unk> 's lane came under sustained attack and troops there and around the city came under fire from the ira <stop>
<start> the increasing violence in derry and elsewhere led to increasing speculation that <unk> without trial would be introduced in northern ireland and on <num> august <num> hundreds of <unk> and nationalists were arrested in dawn raids in derry residents came out onto the streets to resist the arrests and fewer people were taken there than elsewhere nevertheless leading figures including <unk> <unk> and <unk> white were interned in response barricades were erected once again and the third free derry came into existence unlike its predecessors this free derry was marked by a strong ira presence both official and provisional it was defended by armed <unk> — a no @-@ go area one in which british security forces were unable to operate <stop>
<start> gun attacks on the british army increased six soldiers were wounded in the first day after <unk> and shortly afterwards a soldier was killed — the first to be killed by either ira in derry the army moved in in force on <num> august to <unk> the barricades a gun battle ensued in which a young provisional ira officer <unk> <unk> was killed a crowd staging a sit @-@ down protest was <unk> down and the protesters including john hume and ivan cooper arrested with barricades re @-@ appearing as quickly as they were removed the army eventually abandoned their attempt <stop>
<start> the derry <unk> had little contact with the ira elsewhere they had few weapons about twenty which they used mainly for sniping at the same time they launched their bombing campaign in derry unlike in belfast they were careful to avoid killing or injuring innocent people <unk> <unk> wrote that the derry <unk> under martin mcguinness had managed to bomb the city centre until it looked as if it had been hit from the air without causing any civilian casualties <stop>
<start> although both <unk> operated openly neither was in control of free derry the barricades were manned by unarmed <unk> crime was dealt with by a volunteer force called the free derry police which was headed by tony o <unk> a derry footballer and northern ireland international <stop>
<start> an anti @-@ <unk> protest organised by the northern ireland civil rights association <unk> at <unk> camp in january <num> was met with violence from the 1st battalion the parachute regiment <num> <unk> <unk> had organised a march from the <unk> to derry city centre in defiance of a ban on the following sunday <num> january <num> both <unk> were asked and agreed to suspend operations on that day to ensure the march passed off peacefully the british army erected barricades around the free derry area to prevent <unk> from reaching the city centre on the day march organisers turned the march away from the barriers and up to free derry corner but some youths proceeded to the barrier at william street and <unk> soldiers troops from <num> <unk> then moved into free derry and opened fire killing thirteen people all of whom were subsequently found to be unarmed a fourteenth shooting victim died four months later in june <num> like the killing of <unk> and beattie the previous year bloody sunday had the effect of hugely increasing recruitment to the ira even among people who previously would have been <unk> <stop>
<start> both the provisional and official ira stepped up attacks after bloody sunday with the tacit support of the residents local feelings changed however with the killing of ranger william best by the official ira best was a <num> @-@ year @-@ old local man who was home on leave from the british army at his parents house in the <unk> he was abducted interrogated and shot the following day <num> women marched to the republican club offices in protest nine days later on <num> may the official ira declared a ceasefire the provisional ira initially stated that they would not follow suit but after informal approaches to the british government they announced a ceasefire from <num> june martin mcguinness was the derry representative in a party of senior <unk> who travelled to london for talks with william <unk> the secretary of state for northern ireland the talks were not resumed after the ending of the truce following a violent confrontation in belfast when troops prevented catholic families from taking over houses in the <unk> estate <stop>
<start> political pressure for the action against the no @-@ go areas increased after the events of bloody friday in belfast a british army attack was considered inevitable and the ira took the decision not to resist it on <num> july <num> operation <unk> was launched when thousands of british troops equipped with armoured cars and armoured <unk> avres dismantled the barricades and occupied the area <stop>
<start> after operation <unk> the british army controlled the <unk> and <unk> by <unk> large numbers of troops within the area by conducting large @-@ scale search operations that were in fact undertaken for purposes of intelligence gathering and by setting up over a dozen covert observation posts over the following years ira violence in the city was contained to the point where it was possible to believe the war was over in the area although there were still frequent street riots nationalists — even those who did not support the ira — remained <unk> opposed to the army and to the state <stop>
<start> many of the residents original grievances were addressed with the passing of the local government northern ireland act <num> which <unk> the electoral boundaries and introduced universal adult suffrage based on the single <unk> vote <unk> were held in may <num> nationalists gained a majority on the council for the first time since <num> since then the area has been extensively redeveloped with modern housing replacing the old houses and flats the free derry era is commemorated by the free derry wall the murals of the <unk> artists and the museum of free derry <stop>

<start> on the outbreak of world war i in <num> <unk> ware a director of the rio <unk> company found that at <num> years old he was too old to join the british army he used the influence of rio <unk> chairman viscount <unk> to become the commander of a mobile unit of the british red cross he arrived in france in september <num> and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the red cross for this purpose in march <num> with the support of <unk> <unk> <unk> @-@ general of the british expeditionary force ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the imperial war office and the unit was transferred to the british army as the graves <unk> commission the new graves <unk> commission had over <num> @,@ <num> graves of british and imperial soldiers registered by october <num> and <num> @,@ <num> registered by may <num> <stop>
<start> when municipal <unk> began to <unk> ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further <unk> ware began with an agreement with france to build joint british and french <unk> under the understanding that these would be maintained by the french government ware eventually concluded that it was not <unk> to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the french government and subsequently arranged for france to purchase the land grant it in <unk> and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the british the french government agreed under the condition that <unk> respected certain dimensions were accessible by public road were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages similar negotiations were started with the belgian government <stop>
<start> as reports of the grave registration work became public the commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers by <num> <num> @,@ <num> photographs had been dispatched to relatives in march <num> the commission with the support of the red cross began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests the graves <unk> commission became the directorate of graves <unk> and <unk> in the spring of <num> in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to <unk> from relatives of those killed the <unk> 's work was also extended beyond the western front and into other theatres of war with units deployed in greece egypt and mesopotamia <stop>
<start> as the war continued ware and others became concerned about the fate of the graves in the post @-@ war period following a suggestion by the british army the national committee for the care of soldiers graves was appointed by the british government in january <num> with edward prince of wales agreeing to serve as president the national committee for the care of soldiers graves was created with the intention of taking over the work of the directorate of graves <unk> and <unk> after the war the government felt that it was more appropriate to <unk> the work to a specially appointed body rather than to any existing government department by early <num> a number of members of the committee believed a formal imperial organisation would be needed to care for the graves with the help of edward prince of wales ware submitted a memorandum to the imperial war conference in <num> suggesting that an imperial organisation be constituted the suggestion was accepted and on <num> may <num> the imperial war graves commission was established by royal charter with the prince of wales serving as president secretary of state for war lord derby as chairman and ware as vice @-@ chairman the commission 's undertakings began in earnest at the end of the first world war once land for <unk> and memorials had been guaranteed the enormous task of recording the details of the dead could begin by <num> some <unk> @,@ <num> graves had been identified and a further <unk> @,@ <num> casualties were registered as having no known grave <stop>
<start> the scale and associated high number of casualties of the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration of war dead previous to world war i individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers however the war required <unk> of a significant percentage of the population either as volunteers or through conscription an expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated even if they were low @-@ ranking members of the military a committee under <unk> kenyon director of the british museum presented a report to the commission in november <num> detailing how it envisioned the development of the <unk> two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling of <unk> that had developed between serving ranks <stop>
<start> an article in the times on <num> february <num> by <unk> kipling carried the commission 's proposal to a wider audience and described what the graves would look like the article entitled war graves work of imperial commission mr. kipling 's survey was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet graves of the fallen the illustrated booklet was intended to <unk> the impact of kenyon 's report as it included illustrations of <unk> with mature trees and shrubs contrasting the bleak landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos there was an immediate public <unk> following the publication of the reports particularly with regards to the decision to not <unk> the bodies of the dead the reports generated considerable discussion in the press which ultimately led to a heated debate in parliament on <num> may <num> sir james <unk> started the debate followed by speeches by william <unk> @-@ <unk> in favour of the commission 's principles and robert cecil speaking for those <unk> repatriation and opposing <unk> of grave markers winston churchill closed the debate and asked that the issue not proceed to a vote <unk> withdrew his motion allowing the commission to carry out its work assured of support for its principles <stop>
<start> three of the most eminent architects of their day sir herbert baker sir reginald <unk> and sir edwin <unk> were commissioned to design the <unk> and memorials <unk> kipling was appointed literary advisor for the language used for memorial inscriptions <stop>
<start> in <num> the commission built three experimental <unk> at le <unk> <unk> and <unk> following the principles outlined in the kenyon report of these the <unk> communal cemetery and <unk> was agreed to be the most successful having consulted with garden designer gertrude jekyll the architects created a walled cemetery with uniform <unk> in a garden setting augmented by <unk> 's cross of <unk> and <unk> stone of remembrance after some adjustments <unk> became the template for the commission 's building programme <unk> were required because all three experimental <unk> went over budget to ensure future <unk> remained within their budget the commission decided to not build shelters in <unk> that contained less than <num> graves to not place a stone of remembrance in any cemetery with less than <num> graves and to limit the height of cemetery walls to <num> metre <num> @.@ <num> ft <stop>
<start> at the end of <num> the commission had spent £ <num> @,@ <num> and this figure rose to £ <num> @,@ <num> in <num> as construction of <unk> and memorials increased by <num> the commission had established <num> @,@ <num> <unk> which were ready for <unk> <unk> and burials between <num> and <num> the commission was shipping <num> @,@ <num> <unk> a week to france in many cases small <unk> were closed and the graves concentrated in larger ones by <num> when the majority of construction had been completed over <num> <unk> had been built with <num> @,@ <num> <unk> a thousand crosses of <unk> and <num> stones of remembrance <stop>
<start> the commission had also been mandated to individually commemorate each soldier who had no known grave which amounted to <num> @,@ <num> in france and belgium alone the commission initially decided to build <num> monuments on which to commemorate the missing each memorial being located at the site of an important battle along the western front after resistance from the french committee responsible for the <unk> of memorials on french territory the commission revised their plan and reduced the number of memorials and in some cases built memorials to the missing in existing <unk> rather than as separate structures <stop>
<start> reginald <unk> 's <unk> gate was the first memorial to the missing located in europe to be completed and was unveiled on <num> july <num> the <unk> gate <unk> was found to have insufficient space to contain all the names as originally planned and <num> @,@ <unk> names of the missing were instead inscribed on herbert baker 's <unk> <unk> memorial to the missing other memorials followed the helles memorial in gallipoli designed by john james <unk> the <unk> memorial on the somme and the <unk> memorial designed by edwin <unk> and the basra memorial in iraq designed by edward <unk> warren the <unk> and india also erected memorials on which they commemorated their missing the <unk> @-@ <unk> memorial for the forces of india the <unk> memorial by canada the <unk> @-@ <unk> memorial by australia the <unk> wood memorial by south africa and the beaumont @-@ hamel memorial by newfoundland the programme of commemorating the dead of the great war was considered essentially complete with the inauguration of the <unk> memorial in <num> though the <unk> memorial would not be finished until <num> the <unk> @-@ <unk> memorial until <num> and <unk> were still conducting work on the <unk> gate when germany invaded belgium in <num> <stop>
<start> the only memorial created by the commission that was not in the form of a monument or cemetery was the <unk> institute at <unk> egypt — complete with library and <unk> and pathology departments — as its memorial to men of the egyptian labour corps and camel transport corps its erection was agreed with local political pressure <stop>
<start> from the start of the second world war in <num> the commission organised grave registration units and planning ahead based on the experience gained from the first world war earmarked land for use as <unk> when the war began turning in favour of the allies the commission was able to begin restoring its first world war <unk> and memorials it also began the task of commemorating the <num> @,@ <num> commonwealth casualties from the second world war in <num> the commission completed <unk> canadian war cemetery the first of <unk> new <unk> and <num> new memorials eventually over <num> @,@ <num> new <unk> were erected many were made from <unk> wood stone the wider scale of world war ii coupled with manpower shortages and unrest in some countries meant that the construction and restoration programmes took much longer following the war the commission implemented a five @-@ year <unk> renovation programme the <unk> neglect was largely addressed by <num> but there were necessary structural repairs to be made these together with the <unk> of maintenance tasks from before the war took a further <num> years to complete and the programme was not completed until the 1960s <stop>
<start> with the increased number of civilian casualties compared with the world war i winston churchill agreed to ware 's proposal that the commission also maintain a record of commonwealth civilian war deaths a supplemental chapter was added to the imperial war graves commission 's charter on <num> february <num> <unk> the organisation to collect and record the names of civilians who died from enemy action during the second world war which resulted in the creation of the civilian war dead roll of honour the roll eventually contained the names of nearly <num> @,@ <num> civilians the commission and the dean of westminster reached an agreement that the roll would eventually be placed in westminster abbey but not until the roll was complete and hostilities had ended the commission handed over the first six volumes to the dean of westminster on <num> february <num> the final volume was added to the showcase in <num> <stop>
<start> following world war ii the commission recognised that the word imperial within its name was no longer appropriate in the spirit of strengthening national and regional feelings the organisation 's name was changed to commonwealth war graves commission in <num> <stop>
<start> more recent conflicts have sometimes made it impossible for the commission to care for <unk> in a given region or resulted in the destruction of sites altogether <unk> indian cemetery in germany was <unk> after the end of world war ii and until the german <unk> because it was located in an area occupied by russian forces and was not entirely rebuilt until <num> the six @-@ day war and war of <unk> resulted in the destruction of port <unk> memorial and aden memorial and the death of a commission <unk> at suez war memorial cemetery during the lebanese civil war two <unk> in beirut were destroyed and had to be rebuilt the maintenance of war graves and memorials in iraq has remained difficult since iran – iraq war in the 1980s with regular maintenance being impractical since after the gulf war <stop>
<start> the commission has and continues to also provide support for war graves outside its traditional mandate in <num> the british ministry of defence requested the commission 's assistance to design and construct <unk> in the falkland islands for those killed during the <unk> war although these <unk> are not commonwealth war graves commission <unk> the commission manages the administrative responsibilities of these <unk> since <num> the commission has carried out similar management duties on behalf of the british ministry of defence for <unk> and graves of british and imperial soldiers who died during the second boer war in <num> veterans affairs canada employed the commission to develop an approach to locate grave markers for which the canadian minister of veterans affairs has responsibility as of <num> the commission conducts a twelve @-@ year cyclical inspection programme of canadian veterans markers installed at the expense of the government of canada <stop>
<start> in <num> an <unk> excavation discovered mass graves on the edge of <unk> wood outside of <unk> two @-@ hundred and fifty british and australian bodies were excavated from five mass graves which were interred in the newly constructed <unk> <unk> wood military cemetery this was the first new commonwealth war graves commission cemetery in more than <num> years the last such <unk> having been built after the second world war <stop>
<start> the commission is currently responsible for the continued commemoration of <num> @.@ <num> million deceased commonwealth military service members in <num> countries and approximately <num> @,@ <num> civilians who died as a result of enemy action during world war ii commonwealth military service members are commemorated by name on either a <unk> at an identified site of a burial or on a memorial as a result the commission is currently responsible for the care of war dead at over <num> @,@ <num> separate burial sites and maintenance of more than <num> memorials worldwide the vast majority of burial sites are pre @-@ existing communal or municipal <unk> and parish <unk> located in the united kingdom however the commission has itself constructed approximately <num> @,@ <num> war <unk> worldwide the commission has also constructed or commissioned memorials to commemorate the dead who have no known grave the largest of these is the <unk> memorial <stop>
<start> the commission only commemorates those who have died during the designated war years while in commonwealth military service or of causes attributable to service the applicable periods of consideration are <num> august <num> to <num> august <num> for the first world war and <num> september <num> to <num> december <num> for the second world war the end date for the first world war period is the official end of the war while for the second world war the commission selected a date approximately the same period after <unk> day as the official end of the first world war was after the <num> armistice <stop>
<start> <unk> who died as a result of enemy action during the second world war are commemorated differently from those that died as a result of military service they are commemorated by name through the civilian war dead roll of honour located in st george 's chapel in westminster abbey in addition to its mandated duties the commission maintains under arrangement with applicable governments over <num> @,@ <num> non @-@ commonwealth war graves and over <num> @,@ <num> non @-@ war military and civilian graves <stop>
<start> as well as the main principal architects for france and belgium baker <unk> and <unk> there were principal architects appointed for other regions as well sir robert <unk> was principal <unk> for italy macedonia and egypt while sir john james <unk> was principal <unk> for palestine and gallipoli assisted by thomas smith <unk> the principal <unk> for mesopotamia was edward <unk> warren <stop>
<start> as well as these senior architects there was a team of assistant architects who were actually responsible for many of the cemetery and memorial designs these architects were younger and many of them had served in the war the assistant architects were george <unk> gordon <unk> <unk> clement von berg charles henry holden who in <num> became a principal <unk> william harrison <unk> william <unk> <unk> george hartley goldsmith frank <unk> arthur james scott hutton noel ackroyd <unk> and john reginald <unk> other architects that worked for the commission or won competitions for the commission memorials included george <unk> <unk> harold <unk> <unk> <unk> owen rees gordon h. holt and henry philip <unk> de <unk> <stop>

<start> leading <unk> that worked on the memorials and <unk> after the first world war included eric henri <unk> charles thomas wheeler gilbert <unk> and charles <unk> jagger other <unk> both in the inter @-@ war period and after the second world war included william reid dick ernest <unk> basil <unk> alfred turner laurence a. turner walter gilbert henry poole vernon hill robert <unk> bell ferdinand victor <unk> joseph <unk> and gilbert <unk> <stop>
<start> structural design has always played an important part in the commission 's <unk> apart from a few exceptions due to local geological conditions the <unk> follow the same design and uniform aesthetic all over the world this makes the <unk> easily recognisable and distinguishes them from war graves administered by other groups or countries <stop>
<start> a typical cemetery is surrounded by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought @-@ iron gate entrance for <unk> in france and belgium a land <unk> near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the french or belgian governments all but the smallest <unk> contain a register with an inventory of the burials a plan of the plots and rows and a basic history of the cemetery the register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery more recently in larger sites a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign the <unk> within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size <stop>
<start> the cemetery grounds are except in drier climates grass covered with a floral border around the <unk> there is also an absence of any paving between the <unk> rows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a sense of peace however carter and jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a positive experience which deliberately masks and <unk> the nature of the war deaths <stop>
<start> typically <unk> of more than <num> graves contain a cross of <unk> designed by architect reginald <unk> this cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found in <unk> in england with proportions more commonly seen in the celtic cross the cross is normally a <unk> four @-@ point limestone latin cross mounted on an octagonal base and ranging in height from <num> to <num> feet a bronze <unk> blade down is embedded on the face of the cross this cross represents the faith of the majority of the dead and the sword represents the military character of the cemetery intended to link british soldiers and the christian concept of self @-@ sacrifice <stop>
<start> <unk> with more than <num> burials typically have a stone of remembrance designed by edwin <unk> with the inscription their name <unk> for <unk> the concept of the stone of remembrance stone was developed by <unk> kipling to commemorate those of all faiths and none respectively in contrast to the cross of <unk> the design for the stone deliberately avoided shapes associated with particular religions the geometry of the structure was based on studies of the <unk> each stone is <num> @.@ <num> metres <num> ft long and <num> @.@ <num> metres <num> @.@ <num> ft high the shape of the stone has been compared both to that of a sarcophagus and an altar the feature was designed using the principle of <unk> the subtle curves in the design if extended would form a sphere <num> @,@ <unk> feet <num> inches <unk> @.@ <num> m in diameter <stop>
<start> every grave is marked with a <unk> each <unk> contains the national emblem or regimental badge rank name unit date of death and age of each casualty inscribed above an appropriate religious symbol and a more personal dedication chosen by relatives the <unk> use a standard upper case <unk> designed by macdonald gill individual graves are arranged where possible in straight rows and marked by uniform <unk> the vast majority of which are made of portland stone the original <unk> dimensions were <num> centimetres <num> in tall <num> cm <num> in wide and <num> @.@ <num> cm <num> @.@ <num> in thick <stop>
<start> most <unk> are inscribed with a cross except for those deceased known to be <unk> or non @-@ christian in the case of burials of victoria cross or george cross recipients the regimental badge is supplemented by the victoria cross or george cross emblem sometimes a soldier employed a pseudonym because they were too young to serve or were sought by law enforcement in such cases their primary name is shown along with the <unk> served as many <unk> are for unidentified casualties they consequently bear only what could be discovered from the body the <unk> developed by <unk> kipling that appears on the graves of unidentified soldiers for which no details are known is a soldier of the great war known <unk> god some <unk> bear the text believed to be buried in this cemetery when they are believed to be buried in the cemetery but the exact location of the grave is not known in some cases soldiers were buried in collective graves and distinguishing one body from another was not possible and thus one <unk> covers more than one grave the <unk> does not denote any specific details of the death except for its date and even then only if it is known and are deliberately ambiguous about the cause of death <stop>
<start> due to local conditions it was sometimes necessary for the commission to deviate from its standard design in places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes such as thailand and turkey stone @-@ faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal <unk> these measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into <unk> ground in italy <unk> were carved from <unk> <unk> limestone because it was in more plentiful supply in <unk> military cemetery in greece to avoid risk of earthquake damage small <unk> are laid flat on the ground the smaller size of the markers mean that they often lack unit insignia <stop>
<start> commission <unk> are distinctive in treating <unk> as an integral part of the cemetery design originally the <unk> concept was to create an environment where visitors could experience a sense of peace in a setting in contrast to traditionally bleak <unk> <unk> given by arthur william hill the assistant director of the royal <unk> gardens at <unk> enabled the commission to develop cemetery layouts and architectural structures that took into account the placement of suitable plant life <unk> structural and <unk> elements was not unfamiliar to the commission 's architects sir edwin <unk> furthered his long @-@ standing working relationship with <unk> gertrude jekyll whose devotion to traditional cottage garden plants and <unk> greatly influenced the appearance of the <unk> where possible indigenous plants were utilised to enhance sentimental associations with the gardens of home <stop>
<start> variety in texture height and timing of floral display were equally important <unk> <unk> the beds around each <unk> are planted with a mixture of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> low @-@ growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of <unk> ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from <unk> back during rain in <unk> where there are pedestal grave markers dwarf varieties of plants are used instead <stop>
<start> the absence of any form of paving between the <unk> rows contributes to the simplicity of the cemetery designs lawn paths add to the garden <unk> and are irrigated during the dry season in countries where there is insufficient rain where irrigation is inappropriate or impractical dry <unk> is an ecological alternative favoured by the commission 's <unk> as is the case in iraq <unk> areas require a different approach not only for <unk> but also to plants and styles of planting similarly there are separate <unk> <unk> in tropical climates when many <unk> are concentrated within a limited area like along the western front or gallipoli peninsula mobile teams of <unk> operate from a local base elsewhere larger <unk> have their own dedicated staff while small <unk> are usually tended by a single <unk> working part @-@ time <stop>

<start> built to meet the need for small <unk> submarines able to operate in the narrow shallow seas off flanders the vessels were intended to be quickly constructed then shipped by rail and assembled at their port of operation the design effort began in mid @-@ august <num> and by mid @-@ october the first <num> boats were ordered from two german shipyards the german imperial navy subsequently ordered an additional pair of boats to replace two sold to austria @-@ hungary who ordered a further three boats in april <num> a total of <num> <unk> is were built construction of the first boats for germany began in early november <num> all <num> were completed by october <num> several of the first boats underwent trials in german home waters but the rest were assembled and tested at either antwerp or pola the german boats operated primarily in the flanders baltic and constantinople <unk> the boats were about <num> metres <num> ft long and displaced <num> tonnes <num> long tons when surfaced and <num> tonnes <num> long tons while submerged all had two bow torpedo tubes and two torpedoes and were equipped with a deck @-@ mounted machine gun <stop>

<start> in the earliest stages of the first world war the german army 's rapid advance along the north sea coast found the german imperial navy without submarines suitable to operate in the narrow and shallow seas off flanders by <num> august <num> two weeks after the german invasion of belgium the planning of a series of small coastal submarines had already begun <stop>
<start> the german imperial navy stipulated that the submarines must be <unk> by rail which imposed a maximum diameter of <num> @.@ <num> metres <num> ft <num> in the rushed planning effort — which had been assigned the name project <num> — resulted in the type <unk> i design created specifically for operation from flanders the boats were to be about <num> metres <num> ft long and to displace about <num> tonnes <num> long tons with two bow torpedo tubes <stop>
<start> boats of the type <unk> i design were built by two manufacturers germaniawerft of kiel and ag <unk> of <unk> which led to some variations in boats from the two shipyards the eight germaniawerft @-@ built boats were slightly longer at <num> @.@ <num> metres <num> ft <num> in length overall while the twelve <unk> @-@ built boats came in <num> centimetres <num> @.@ <num> in shorter than their counterparts all were <num> @.@ <num> metres <num> ft <num> in abeam and had a draft of <num> @.@ <num> metres <num> ft <num> in the boats all displaced <num> tonnes <num> long tons while surfaced but differed slightly in displacement submerged the slightly longer germaniawerft boats displaced <num> tonnes <num> long tons while submerged as they weighed <num> <unk> <num> @.@ <num> long tons more than the <unk> boats <stop>
<start> the <unk> of the boats consisted of a single propeller shaft driven by a <unk> germaniawerft or <unk> <unk> diesel engine on the surface or a <unk> @-@ <unk> electric motor for underwater travel the <unk> boats were capable of nearly <num> @.@ <num> knots <num> @.@ <num> km h <num> @.@ <num> mph on the surface and a little more than <num> knots <num> km h <num> @.@ <num> mph submerged the germaniawerft boats were about <num> knot <num> @.@ <num> km h <num> @.@ <num> mph slower than their <unk> @-@ made counterparts the boats were equipped with two <num> @-@ <unk> <num> @.@ <num> in bow torpedo tubes and carried two torpedoes they were also armed with a single <num> @-@ millimetre <num> @.@ <num> in machine gun affixed to the deck <stop>
<start> the german imperial navy ordered its first fifteen type <unk> i boats on <num> october <num> eight boats — numbered <unk> @-@ <num> to <unk> @-@ <num> — were ordered from germaniawerft of kiel and seven boats — numbered <unk> @-@ <num> to u @-@ <num> — from ag <unk> of <unk> after two of the class <unk> @-@ <num> and <unk> @-@ <num> were sold in february <num> to ally austria @-@ hungary becoming u @-@ <num> and u @-@ <num> in the austro @-@ hungarian navy the german imperial navy ordered <unk> @-@ <num> and <unk> @-@ <num> from <unk> a further three for austria @-@ hungary — u @-@ <num> u @-@ <num> and u @-@ <num> — had been ordered from <unk> by april bringing the total number constructed to <num> <stop>

<start> the process of shipping the submarines by rail involved breaking the submarines down into what was essentially a knock down kit each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway <unk> type <unk> i boats destined for service with the flanders flotilla made a five @-@ day journey to antwerp for the <unk> to three @-@ week assembly process after assembly at antwerp the boats were towed by barge to bruges for trials boats selected for service in the mediterranean were sent to the austro @-@ hungarian port of pola for assembly the total time from departure of the <unk> from the shipyard to operational readiness for the boats was about six weeks <stop>
<start> by july <num> all seventeen of the german imperial navy type <unk> is had been completed <stop>
<start> during their trials the type <unk> is were found to be too small and too slow and had a reputation for being <unk> one commander compared his type <unk> i to a <unk> machine according to authors r. h. gibson and maurice <unk> in their <num> book the german <unk> war <num> – <num> the <unk> did not have enough power to chase down <unk> while surfaced and lacked the endurance to spend any extended amount of time underwater exhausting their batteries after little over an hour 's running in @-@ service use revealed another problem with a single propeller shaft engine combination if either component failed the u @-@ boat was almost totally disabled <stop>
<start> another reported problem with the type <unk> is was the tendency to break trim after the firing of torpedoes the boats were equipped with <unk> tanks designed to flood and offset the loss of the c <num> torpedo 's <num> @,@ <num> @-@ pound <num> kg weight but this system did not always function properly as a result when firing from <unk> depth the boat could <unk> after firing or if too much weight was taken on <unk> to the depths when <unk> @-@ <num> torpedoed and sank italian submarine <unk> in june <num> the tank failed to properly compensate forcing the entire crew to run to the stern to offset the trim imbalance <stop>

<start> in <num> a british court of inquiry investigated the crash of <unk> 's liberator ii <unk> but was unable to determine the probable cause finding only that it was an accident and the aircraft became uncontrollable for reasons which cannot be established a popular theory was insufficient technical maintenance leading to <unk> aircraft controls despite this finding the political context of the event coupled with a variety of curious circumstances immediately gave rise to speculation that <unk> 's death had been no accident and may in fact have been the direct result of a soviet british or even polish conspiracy <stop>

<start> on <num> september <num> <unk> was assassinated in a palace conspiracy involving members of the <unk> guard and several of his freedmen on the same day <unk> was declared emperor by the roman senate this was the first time the senate elected a roman emperor as the new ruler of the roman empire he vowed to restore liberties which had been curtailed during the <unk> government of <unk> <stop>
<start> <unk> 's brief reign was marred by financial difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the roman army a revolt by the <unk> guard in october <num> essentially forced him to adopt an heir after some <unk> <unk> adopted trajan a young and popular general as his successor after barely fifteen months in office <unk> died of natural causes on <num> january <num> upon his death he was succeeded and deified by trajan <stop>
<start> although much of his life remains obscure <unk> was considered a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians <unk> 's greatest success was his ability to ensure a peaceful transition of power after his death thus founding the <unk> – <unk> dynasty <stop>
<start> marcus <unk> <unk> was born in the village of <unk> <num> kilometers north of rome to the family of marcus <unk> <unk> <unk> consul in <num> and <unk> <unk> ancient sources report the date as either <num> or <num> he had at least one attested sister named <unk> who married lucius <unk> <unk> <unk> the brother of the future emperor <unk> <stop>
<start> like <unk> the founder of the <unk> dynasty <unk> was a member of the italian nobility rather than one of the elite of rome nevertheless the <unk> were among the most esteemed and prominent political families of the late republic and early empire attaining <unk> in each successive generation the direct ancestors of <unk> on his father 's side all named marcus <unk> <unk> were associated with imperial circles since the time of emperor augustus <num> bc – ad <num> <stop>
<start> his great @-@ grandfather was consul in <num> bc in replacement and abdicated and governor of asia in the same year his grandfather became consul <unk> in july of either <num> or <num> and was known as a personal friend of emperor <unk> ad <num> – <num> accompanying the emperor during his voluntary seclusion on capri from <num> onwards dying in <num> <unk> 's father finally attained the <unk> in <num> under emperor <unk> <num> – <num> the <unk> were connected with the julio @-@ <unk> dynasty through the marriage of <unk> <unk> 's brother <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> the great @-@ granddaughter of <unk> <stop>
<start> not much of <unk> 's early life or career is recorded but it appears he did not pursue the usual administrative or military career he was <unk> @-@ elect in the year <num> and like his ancestors moved in imperial circles as a skilled diplomat and strategist as an advisor to emperor <unk> he successfully helped detect and expose the <unk> conspiracy of <num> <unk> what his contribution to the investigation was is not known but his services must have been considerable since they earned him rewards equal to those of <unk> 's guard prefect <unk> he received <unk> honors — which was usually reserved for military victories — and the right to have his statues placed throughout the palace <stop>
<start> according to the contemporary poet martial <unk> also held <unk> 's literary abilities in high esteem <unk> him as the <unk> of our time another prominent member of <unk> 's entourage was <unk> an old and respected general who had celebrated military <unk> during the 40s it appears <unk> befriended <unk> during his time as an imperial advisor and may have asked him to watch over <unk> 's youngest son <unk> when <unk> departed for the jewish war in <num> <stop>
<start> the suicide of <unk> on <num> june <num> brought the julio @-@ <unk> dynasty to an end leading to the chaotic year of the four <unk> which saw the successive rise and fall of the emperors <unk> <unk> and <unk> until the accession of <unk> on <num> december <num> <unk> nothing is known of <unk> 's whereabouts during <num> but despite the fact that <unk> was his brother @-@ in @-@ law he appears to have been one of the earliest and strongest supporters of the <unk> <stop>
<start> for services unknown he was rewarded with a <unk> early in <unk> 's reign in <num> this was a remarkable honour not only because he held this office early under the new regime but also because it was an ordinary <unk> instead of a less prestigious <unk> <unk> making him one of the few non @-@ <unk> to be honoured in this way under <unk> after <num> <unk> again disappears from historical record presumably continuing his career as an inconspicuous advisor under <unk> <num> – <num> and his sons titus <num> – <num> and <unk> <num> – <num> <stop>
<start> he re @-@ emerges during the revolt of <unk> in <num> on <num> january <num> the governor of <unk> superior lucius antonius <unk> and his two <unk> at <unk> <unk> xiv <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> against the roman empire with the aid of a tribe of the <unk> the governor of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> moved to the region at once assisted by the <unk> of <unk> titus <unk> <unk> within twenty @-@ four days the rebellion was crushed and its leaders at <unk> <unk> punished the <unk> <unk> were sent to the front of <unk> while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded <stop>
<start> <unk> opened the year following the revolt by sharing the <unk> with <unk> again the honour suggested <unk> had played a part in uncovering the conspiracy perhaps in a fashion similar to what he did during the <unk> conspiracy under <unk> alternatively <unk> may have selected <unk> as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status @-@ <unk> of the regime the revolt had been suppressed and the empire could return to order <stop>
<start> on <num> september <num> <unk> was assassinated in a palace conspiracy organised by court officials the <unk> <unk> the <unk> calendar records that the same day the senate proclaimed marcus <unk> <unk> emperor despite his political experience this was a remarkable choice <unk> was old and <unk> and had spent much of his career out of the public light prompting both ancient and modern authors to speculate on his involvement in <unk> 's assassination <stop>
<start> according to <unk> <unk> the conspirators approached <unk> as a potential successor prior to the assassination which indicates that he was at least aware of the plot <unk> by contrast does not mention <unk> but he may have omitted his role out of <unk> considering the works of <unk> were published under <unk> 's direct descendants trajan and <unk> it would have been less than sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder on the other hand <unk> lacked widespread support in the empire and as a known <unk> loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators the precise facts have been obscured by history but modern historians believe <unk> was proclaimed emperor solely on the initiative of the senate within hours after the news of the assassination broke <stop>
<start> although he appeared to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health <unk> was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and <unk> furthermore he had close connections with the <unk> dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the senate <unk> had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of <unk> he knew that to <unk> even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict rather than decline the invitation and risk <unk> he accepted the decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war but neither the senate nor <unk> appears to have been involved in the conspiracy against <unk> <stop>
<start> following the accession of <unk> as emperor the senate passed <unk> <unk> on <unk> his coins and statues were melted his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records in many instances existing portraits of <unk> such as those found on the <unk> <unk> were simply <unk> to fit the likeness of <unk> this allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material in addition the vast palace which <unk> had erected on the <unk> hill known as the <unk> palace was renamed the house of the people and <unk> himself took up residence in <unk> 's former villa in the gardens of <unk> <stop>
<start> the change of government was welcome particularly to the <unk> who had been harshly persecuted during <unk> 's reign as an immediate gesture of goodwill towards his supporters <unk> publicly <unk> that no <unk> would be put to death as long as he remained in office he called an end to trials based on treason released those who had been imprisoned under these charges and granted amnesty to many who had been exiled <stop>
<start> all properties which had been confiscated by <unk> were returned to their respective families <unk> also sought to involve the senate in his government but this was not entirely successful he continued to rely largely on friends and advisors that were known and trusted and by maintaining friendly relations with the pro @-@ <unk> faction of the senate he incurred hostility which may have been the cause for at least one conspiracy against his life <stop>
<start> having been proclaimed emperor solely on the initiative of the senate <unk> had to introduce a number of measures to gain support among the roman populace as was custom by this time a change of emperor was expected to bring with it a generous payment of gifts and money to the people and the army accordingly a <unk> of <num> <unk> per head was bestowed upon the citizens while the soldiers of the <unk> guard received a <unk> which may have amounted to as much as <num> <unk> per person this was followed by a string of economic reforms intended to alleviate the burden of taxation from the most <unk> romans <stop>
<start> to the poorest <unk> granted <unk> of land worth up to <num> million <unk> he <unk> parents and their children from a <num> inheritance tax and he made loans to italian landowners on the condition that they pay interest of <num> to their municipality to support the children of <unk> families <unk> schemes which were later expanded by trajan <unk> pius and marcus aurelius furthermore numerous taxes were <unk> and privileges granted to roman provinces <unk> he probably abolished the <unk> <unk> the additional tax which all jews throughout the empire had to pay some of his coins bear the legend <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> abolition of malicious prosecution regarding the jewish tax <stop>
<start> before long <unk> 's expenses strained the economy of rome and although perhaps not ruinous to the extent once suggested by <unk> necessitated the formation of a special commission of economy to drastically reduce <unk> the most superfluous religious sacrifices games and horse races were abolished while new income was generated from <unk> 's former possessions including the <unk> of ships estates and even furniture large amounts of money were obtained from <unk> 's silver and gold statues and <unk> forbade that similar images be made in his honor <stop>
<start> because he reigned only briefly <unk> 's public works were few instead completing projects which had been initiated under <unk> rule this included extensive repairs to the roman road system and the expansion of the <unk> the latter program was headed by the former consul <unk> julius <unk> who helped to put an end to abuses and later published a significant work on rome 's water supply de <unk> <unk> <unk> the only major landmarks constructed under <unk> were a <unk> known as the <unk> <unk> and a small imperial <unk> begun by <unk> which linked the <unk> of augustus to the temple of peace little remains partly because the via <unk> <unk> <unk> cuts across it <stop>
<start> despite <unk> 's measures to remain popular with the senate and the roman people support for <unk> remained strong in the army which had called for his <unk> immediately after the assassination in an attempt to appease the soldiers of the <unk> guard <unk> had dismissed their prefect titus <unk> <unk> — one of the chief conspirators against <unk> — and replaced him with a former commander <unk> <unk> <stop>
<start> likewise the generous <unk> bestowed upon the soldiers following his accession was expected to swiftly silence any protests against the violent regime change the <unk> considered these measures insufficient however and demanded the execution of <unk> 's assassins which <unk> refused continued dissatisfaction with this state of affairs would ultimately lead to the <unk> crisis of <unk> 's reign <stop>
<start> while the swift transfer of power following <unk> 's death had prevented a civil war from <unk> <unk> 's position as an emperor soon proved too vulnerable and his benign nature turned into a reluctance to assert his authority upon his accession he had ordered a halt to treason trials but at the same time allowed the prosecution of <unk> by the senate to continue this measure led to chaos as everyone acted in his own interests while trying to settle scores with personal enemies leading the consul <unk> to famously remark that <unk> 's <unk> was ultimately <unk> to <unk> 's anarchy early in <num> a conspiracy led by the senator <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> failed but once again <unk> refused to put the conspirators to death much to the disapproval of the senate <stop>
<start> the situation was further aggravated by the absence of a clear successor made more pressing because of <unk> 's old age and sickness he had no natural children of his own and only distant relatives who were unsuited for political office a successor would have to be chosen from among the governors or generals in the empire and it appears that by <num> <unk> was considering to adopt marcus cornelius <unk> <unk> <unk> the powerful governor of syria this was covertly opposed by those who supported the more popular military commander marcus <unk> <unk> commonly known as trajan a general of the armies at the german frontier <stop>
<start> in october <num> these tensions came to a head when the <unk> guard led by <unk> <unk> laid siege to the imperial palace and took <unk> hostage he was forced to submit to their demands agreeing to hand over those responsible for <unk> 's death and even giving a speech <unk> the rebellious <unk> titus <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 's former <unk> were sought out and killed <unk> was unharmed in this assault but his authority was damaged beyond repair <stop>
<start> he realized that his position was no longer <unk> without the support of an heir who had the approval of both the army and the people shortly thereafter he announced the adoption of trajan as his successor and with this decision all but abdicated trajan was formally bestowed with the title of caesar and shared the <unk> with <unk> in <num> <stop>
<start> contrary to the view here popularized by <unk> <unk> however <unk> had in fact little choice with regard to his successor faced with a major crisis he desperately needed the support of a man who could restore his damaged reputation the only candidate with sufficient military experience <unk> ancestry and connections was trajan likewise edward <unk> 's assertion that <unk> <unk> established a tradition of succession through adoption among the five good <unk> has found little support among modern historians <stop>
<start> on <num> january <num> at the start of his fourth <unk> <unk> suffered a stroke during a private audience shortly thereafter he was struck by a fever and died at his villa in the gardens of <unk> on <num> january he was deified by the senate and his ashes were laid to rest in the <unk> of augustus <stop>
<start> <unk> was succeeded without incident by his adopted son trajan who was greeted by the roman populace with much enthusiasm according to pliny the younger trajan dedicated a temple in honour of <unk> yet no trace of it has ever been found nor was a commemorative series of coins for the <unk> <unk> issued until ten years after his death according to <unk> <unk> however the guard prefect responsible for the mutiny against <unk> <unk> <unk> was dismissed upon trajan 's accession <stop>
<start> due to the lack of written sources on this period much of <unk> 's life has remained obscure the most substantial surviving account of the reign of <unk> was written by the 3rd @-@ century historian <unk> <unk> his roman history which spans nearly a millennium from the arrival of <unk> in italy until the year <unk> was composed more than one hundred years after <unk> had died further details are added by an abridged biography from the <unk> de <unk> a work alleged to have been authored by the 4th @-@ century historian aurelius victor <stop>
<start> a more comprehensive text presumed to describe the life of <unk> in closer detail is the <unk> by the contemporary historian <unk> the <unk> is an account of the history of rome covering three decades from the suicide of emperor <unk> in <num> until the death of <unk> in <num> unfortunately a substantial part of the work has been lost with only the first five books covering the year of the four <unk> remaining in the introduction to his biography of <unk> julius <unk> however <unk> speaks highly of <unk> describing his reign as the dawn of a most happy age when <unk> caesar blended things once <unk> sovereignty and freedom <stop>
<start> the surviving histories speak equally positively of <unk> 's brief reign although none offer a substantial commentary on his policies both <unk> <unk> and aurelius victor emphasize his wisdom and <unk> with <unk> commending his decision to adopt trajan as his heir these views were later popularized by the 18th @-@ century historian edward <unk> in his history of the decline and fall of the roman empire <unk> considered <unk> the first of the five good <unk> five successive rulers under whom the roman empire was governed by absolute power under the guidance of wisdom and virtue from <num> until <num> nevertheless even <unk> notes that compared to his successors <unk> may have lacked the necessary qualifications for a successful reign <stop>
<start> modern history has expanded upon this sentiment characterizing <unk> as a well @-@ <unk> but weak and <unk> ruler the roman senate enjoyed renewed liberties under his rule but <unk> 's <unk> of the state finances and lack of authority over the army ultimately brought rome near the edge of a significant crisis the mutiny led by <unk> <unk> was never intended as a coup but a calculated attempt to put pressure on the emperor the adoption of trajan expanded his power base with a respected reliable general as his successor <unk> concludes that <unk> 's real talents were in fact ill @-@ suited to the <unk> <stop>
<start> his place in roman history is therefore summarized as a necessary if tumultuous stop @-@ gap before the <unk> @-@ <unk> dynasties it is a fact of irony that even the only major public work completed during his reign the <unk> of <unk> ultimately became known as the <unk> <unk> or transitional forum <stop>
<start> two modern statues which commemorate <unk> can be found in towns associated with him there is an <unk> statue in gloucester england a town which was founded in his honour it is at the entrance to <unk> street there is also a statue at his alleged birthplace <unk> in italy at <unk> <unk> street <stop>

The/D 101-year-old/A magazine/N has/V never/R had/V to/R woo/V advertisers/N with/C quite/R so/R much/A fervor/N before/R ./O
It/P largely/R rested/V on/C its/P hard-to-fault/A demographics/N :/O 10.8/O million/O subscribers/N in/C the/D first/A

a/D year/N ago/R ;/O an/D average/A age/N of/C 42/O for/C readers/N --/O at/C the/D height/N of/C their/P consuming/N years/N ;/O loyalty/N to/R the/D tune/N of/C an/D 85/O %/N average/A subscription/N renewal/N rate/N ./O
The/D magazine/N had/V its/P best/A year/N yet/R in/C 1988/O ,/O when/W it/P celebrated/V its/P centennial/N and/C racked/V up/R a/D 17/O %/N gain/N in/C ad/N pages/N ,/O to/R 283/O ./O
But/C this/D year/N ,/O when/W the/D hullabaloo/N surrounding/V its/P centennial/N died/V ,/O so/R too/R did/V some/D advertiser/N interest/N ./O
The/D reason/N ,/O ad/N executives/N say/V ,/O is/V that/C the/D entire/A magazine/N business/N has/V been/V soft/A --/O and/C National/N Geographic/N has/V some/D quirks/N
that/W make/V it/P especially/R unattractive/A during/C a/D soft/A market/N ./O
Perhaps/R the/D biggest/A of/C those/D factors/N is/V its/P high/A ad/N prices/N --/O $/O 130,000/O for/C a/D four-color/A page/N ,/O vs./O $/O 47,000/O for/C the/D Smithsonian/N ,/O a/D comparable/A publication/N with/C a/D far/R smaller/A circulation/N ./O
When/W ad/N dollars/N are/V tight/A ,/O the/D high/A page/N cost/N is/V a/D major/A deterrent/N for/C advertisers/N ,/O who/W generally/R want/V to/R appear/V regularly/R in/C a/D publication/N or/C not/R at/C all/D ./O
Even/R though/C National/N Geographic/N offers/V far/R more/A readers/N than/C does/V a/D magazine/N like/C Smithsonian/N ,/O ``/O the/D page/N costs/V you/P

To/R combat/V that/D problem/N ,/O National/N Geographic/N ,/O like/C other/A magazines/N ,/O began/V offering/V regional/A editions/N allowing/V advertisers/N to/R appear/V in/C only/R a/D portion/N of/C its/P magazines/N --/O for/C example/N ,/O ads/N can/M run/V only/R in/C the/D magazines/N sent/V to/R subscribers/N in/C the/D largest/A 25/O markets/N ./O
But/C the/D magazine/N was/V slower/A than/C its/P competitors/N to/R come/V up/R with/C its/P regional/A editions/N ,/O and/C until/C last/A year/N offered/V fewer/A of/C them/P than/C did/V competitors/N ./O

Another/D sticking/A point/N for/C advertisers/N was/V National/N Geographic/N 's/P tradition/N of/C lumping/V its/P ads/N together/R ,/O usually/R at/C the/D beginning/N or/C end/N of/C the/D magazine/N ,/O rather/R than/C spreading/V ads/N out/R among/C its/P articles/N ,/O as/C most/A magazines/N do/V ./O

It/P now/R offers/V 30/O regional/A editions/N ,/O it/P very/R recently/R began/V running/V ads/N adjacent/A to/R articles/N ,/O and/C it/P has/V been/V beefing/V up/R its/P sales/N force/N ./O
